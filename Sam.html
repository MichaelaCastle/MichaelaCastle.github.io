        <p id="TeaserText">Slowly, the boy flutters his eyes open. Where is he? What happened?<span class="br"></span>
        He looks around to get a sense of his surroundings. The boy seems to be in a fairly old house. The plumbing drums and creaks, the soft green paint on the walls has started to chip away over time, and the cushions of the dark couch he's on are rough and worn down. Despite that, the place as a whole has a warm and inviting atmosphere, and he can't quite place why. Whatever this place is, the room he's in looks to be a living room. There are two couches that face each other with a coffee table in between them.<span class="br"></span>
        A searing hot wave of pain jolts up his arm when the boy tries to sit up. He inhales sharply and falls back onto the couch, now remembering what happened before he somehow got here. There was a wolf attack. He's lucky he was able to fend them off for the most part, even if he didn't make it out unharmed. But how did he get here?<span class="br"></span>
        He looks down at his arm, finally noticing the bandage wrapped around the wound, which fresh blood starts to stain. He must've opened the wound again when he tried to sit up. Who bandaged his arm though?<span class="brLarge"></span>
        The boy doesn't have to wonder for long, as a green eyed blonde takes a seat on the couch across from him.<span class="br"></span>
        "Don't strain yourself, you're safe here. You were attacked, so I brought you here to heal you," the blonde says, his voice... Oh, his voice is so soft and gentle. That alone is almost enough to soothe the boy.<span class="br"></span>
        "W-who are you?"<span class="br"></span>
        The blonde smiles politely, a shy kind of smile. "I'm Sam. Who I am doesn't matter though, you should focus on resting so your arm can heal."</p>
