                <h1>Jacob x Sam</h1>
            </summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This was it, this was the address. Jacob knew this kid had rich parents, but he didn't expect his house to be as big as a mansion. The white building towers above the midget as he looks at all the intricate details on the walls and the fancy windows, his vivid blue eyes scanning over it all in awe. But he's here for a reason, so he snaps himself out of it and walks up to the door, knocking a few times.</p>
                <p>Soon enough, the door swings open to reveal a younger kid, his blond hair a complete mess. His clothes are atrociously bright, and his shirt has some nerdy pun on it. And he has on these big, Harry Potter style glasses. But most noticeably, he looks to be younger than Jacob. And this kid is supposed to be Jacob's tutor.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Did he get the wrong address? This kid looks like an 8 year old with ADHD.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>It's clear once the boy speaks that this is indeed the correct place. "Are you Jacob? Come in! What subject do you need help on? Is it science? Math? Actually, it doesn't really matter, either way it'll be fun~!" He speaks so fast that all his words slur together and sound like one big string of random sounds. Jacob heard his name in that jumble of words though, so this must be the right place.</p>
                <p>Before he knows it, the excited blond grabs Jacob's arm and drags him into the house, practically jumping with joy. "My parents are busy right now, so we have the whole house to ourselves. Would you rather work in the living room or the kitchen?"</p>
                <p>It takes a few seconds for Jacob to answer, the midget is too shocked by how big the inside is to speak. It's massive. Just the first room is twice the size of his entire house. "Living room..." The brunette manages to get out, gaping at what this kid lives in.</p>
                <p>The younger boy giggles softly, and it is just the cutest sound Jacob has ever heard. It was just so innocent and pure. "We won't always be meeting in this house, my parents just like staying in this house to make business deals~ Don't be overwhelmed by the size." He leads Jacob down a fancy hallway to the living room, where a huge tv screen is on the wall. Practically a cinema tv screen. In this kids house. Jacob didn't even know that was possible.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"What was your name again?"</p>
                <p>"Sam! Didn't you check who was going to be tutoring you?"</p>
                <p>That almost sounded like an insult, so Jacob looks at Sam, but the boy looks so innocent, it's obvious he meant no harm. Honestly, Sam looks like the happiest boy alive. "Are you always this... Intense?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam shakes his head, finally standing still for a full twenty seconds. "Sorry, I just... I've never had a friend, and... I never get to talk about math or science with anyone-"</p>
                <p>Jacob feels his chest tighten as Sam explains himself, giving him a pitiful look. This kid is just too precious for him to handle. He sets his school bag down by the coffee table, which is surrounded by a few couches, so he takes a seat. "Is that why you want to tutor? I'm a grade above you I think, how are you going to teach me?..."</p>
                <p>Being asked about that makes Sam beam with delight. "I know high school math, I'm pretty sure I can teach you your math~"</p>
                <p>The brunette's jaw drops. How many times is this weird looking kid going to surprise him like this?! "You what? I... I barely know my multiplication-" Sam laughs, a carefree and giddy type of infectious laughter that makes a smile tug at Jacob's lips. "Oh, shut up, it's not easy!" He pushes Sam playfully, which makes the bright green eyed male laugh more.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Let's just see what we have to work on, shall we?" He gestures to Jacob's bag, ready to get to work tutoring.</p>
                <p>After a groan of reluctance, Jacob opens his bag and pulls out his school work, setting it down on the coffee table along with two pencils. The blonde immediately starts to scan over the problems, his eyes lighting up with anticipation. This is what Sam considers fun.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Your handwriting is hideous but I see where you messed up. 1 + 1 is not 5." The bluntness that Sam has makes Jacob blush a little at his own simple mistakes. The blonde picks up a pencil and starts correcting all of Jacob's errors, which doesn't help Jacob that much, but once he's done, he starts to go over the reasoning behind the errors and how to remember not to make them again. That really does help Jacob.</p>

            <summary><h1>Jay x Jacob</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>"Sam, c'mon~! You should get out in the sun some more. It's only lunch!" Jacob pleads with the green eyed blonde for the fifth time this week. He hates seeing his best friend like this. He doesn't remember the last time he saw Sam smile, genuinely. And every time Sam flashes him that reassuring smile, it stabs through his heart like a knife. All he wants is for him to get out and get some sun. They're still kids after all, he shouldn't have to be cooped up with all this paperwork.</p>
                <p>Despite the midgets efforts, Sam shakes his head. He needs to get this work done. The only time he has is during school lunchtime, he can't afford to throw it away. If he did, he wouldn't just be throwing his time away, he'd be throwing Simon's life away. So, just like every other time Jacob has asked, he shakes his head, continuing to get some paperwork done, ignoring the food he should be eating.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The constant rejection is harder to deal with than Jacob thought it would be. He knew it'd be hard, but it's like nothing he does has any effect whatsoever. Sam doesn't want his help. He doesn't want to deal with the brunette. He's just a nuisance. All Jacob ever wants is to let Sam have fun, help him see the joy in life again, but nothing he does actually gets to him.</p>
                <p>With a sigh, he nods and picks up his lunch tray from the table. "Alright. Well, if you need me, you know where to find me. It really would be good for you to get outside and take a break. Even if it's just for one period of one school day. But I can't force you." It takes everything in him to keep the pain from reaching his voice, but he manages. "I'm not abandoning you, I'll be here for you when you're ready to accept my help." With that, he reaches down to pick up his backpack and sling it over his shoulder before walking off with his lunch tray.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He can't stay around Sam. It's crazy to say this, but being around Sam is toxic. He misses the happy, nerdy kid he used to be. The excitable and curious boy with the cutest smile and laugh. Now... Now his laugh is silent. Some of what's happened makes sense, but why did his laugh have to change? Jacob loved hearing and seeing the blonde laugh, but now it's silent. Now it's missing that life and energy. Someone sucked the life out if his Sam and he doesn't know how to put it back.</p>
                <p>It's all he can think about as he makes his way to the outside door. He can't even get the guy to come outside with him to have some lunch together for one day. For just one period, 40 minutes. Now that's just too much to ask for.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Luckily, since it's a little chilly out today, nobody else decided to have lunch outside. So Jacob is able to go over to the picnic bench in peace and set his things down without anyone around to judge him. He's not even hungry. No, everything hurts too much to be hungry. So instead of eating, he sets his food tray aside and puts his head down in his arms, crying.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Maybe if he was a better friend, none of this would've had to happen. He knows Sam said it's not his fault and that there was nothing he could do to stop it, but that can't be true. He could've done so much more to save Sam before it was too late, but he was pathetic and cowardly, and now Sam is trapped in a blackhole of guilt and sorrow, and he can't reach him to help pull him out. Not to mention, now his grades are starting to drop since his best friend/tutor has chosen work over being a kid. It all just hurts. And it's all hi--</p>
                <p>His train of thought is interrupted by the sound of someone nearby. Jacob looks up quickly and glances around, not seeing anyone. But then he hears it again, and he focuses on the direction the sound came from. The forest just outside of school property? Why would someone be there? He wipes away his tears to clear his vision, sniffling softly. "Who's there?" His voice is hoarse, but that can't be helped. What steps out of the trees is definitely not what he expected though.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Some dude with overgrown, curly blond hair covering nearly all of his face and clothes that look like they came from a dumpster. His shirt and pants are all torn, bloody, and dirty. He looks like he just stepped out of a cave or something. Now that it occurred to Jacob, he sees it even more. This blond guy is also very tall and looks pretty strong, just like what you'd think of a caveman being. But he's also absurdly skinny, even from a distance Jacob can see his ribs, the individual bones, which is concerning.</p>
                <p>The guy doesn't say anything, he just looks at Jacob like he's some kind of foreign alien, his electric blue eyes scanning everything for any signs of danger. Those blue eyes... Jacob doesnt know why, but he's just drawn to those beautiful, big blue eyes. The rest of this guy could use some obvious work, but those eyes...</p>
                <p>The midget pushes himself up from the bench and wanders over to the edge of the school grounds, looking at this guy through the fence. "Who are you...?" It's debatable if the stranger even understood what that question meant, he certainly doesn't look like he understood. And the moment Jacob gets close to the fence, the stranger scrambles back, as if Jacob was going to somehow kill him through the fence. "I'm not going to hurt you... I'm Jacob. Do you have a name?" He says in a gentler tone, trying not to scare the stranger any more. He finds the blonde intriguing, he wants to know where he came from, why he's in the woods, what... happened to him.</p>
                <p>The stranger keeps his distance, struggling to make his mouth form the sounds needed to make a word. "J-J-Ja... J-Jac--"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Unbeknownst to Jacob, the stranger was just trying to repeat his name. Very slowly. He doesn't realize this and assumes he's trying to say 'Jay.' "Jay? That's a pretty name~ How old are you?" The stranger doesn't even look to be a teenager, which is even more concerning. Another lost soul... Just like Sam...</p>
                <p>The stranger doesn't seem to understand the concept of age, tilting his head in confusion, his curly locks bouncing with the movement. It's clear this guy is very confused about every little thing going on. It doesn't look like he even knows this is a school. He just looks... Frightened. Like a scared child that just got thrown into the world. But those eyes... Those eyes! There's still hope in them. There's still life. Maybe Jacob can't help Sam, maybe he's too stupid to understand how to help someone he's known for a few years now, but maybe... Maybe he can help this boy.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Just the thought of seeing this boy smile instead of looking all paranoid makes Jacob feel better. Like he has a purpose, like he can do something to help at least one person again. But... They're separated by a fence. He's climbed over this fence many times to skip the rest of school, but he has no idea if it's safe to be with this stranger. Still, the kid obviously needs help. He's not in good shape. Nobody who looks like a caveman is in good shape. After debating in his head for a few moments, he decides it's worth the risk. "Can I hop to your side of the fence?" He asks slowly, trying to make motions to explain as he talks to help the stranger understand what he's saying. When he gets no response, he assumes that means yes and goes back to grab his bookbag before returning to the fence. He tosses the bag over, the thud on the ground making the boy jump and hide behind a tree trunk. Then, he backs up to get a running start, leaping up to get over the fence. Since he's done it so many times, it's easy for him to be successful.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Once on the other side, the brunette brushes himself off and hops up to his feet, picking his bag back up. "C'mon, let's go somewhere a bit better than here~" He says as he gestures for the boy to follow, starting to wander off somewhere. Surprisingly, the stranger follows. He keeps his distance, but he does follow along.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Unfortunately, Jacob will never find out that Sam did decide to take him up on his offer. About fifteen minutes before the period was supposed to end, Sam got to the door to the courtyard and looked out at the bench, where Jacob's tray of untouched food remains with no Jacob in sight. With a sigh, he lowers his head defeatedly and heads back to the lunchroom to wait for the period to finish.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>White.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>As far as the eye could see. An endless white sheet. Death clothed in a disguise of innocence.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The flurry of snowflakes whips and stings Jay's skin as he holds Jacob close to his chest, trudging through the frozen forest. He can't feel his feet, bare and freezing in the harsh winter weather. Jacob needed the shoes more than him, Jacob needed the warmth more. The brunette is his life force, this little guy is a star. He shines as brightly as the sun. Nothing else matters but making sure Jacob makes it out alive. Jay will go through whatever it takes to get him to safety. The midget's frail and undernourished body can't stand this cold, endless blizzard, so Jay must be his warmth and his strength. </p>
                <p>The walk has taken three days, without stopping for sleep or food once. Nothing else matters but Jacob. Just keep walking. If the blonde can't get Jacob to civilization soon... It doesn't matter that every bone in his body aches, it doesn't matter that he can barely even stand with the harsh wind trying to knock him down, it doesn't matter that using magic to keep Jacob alive is slowly draining him. Just keep walking.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Then...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>A light.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Oh, thank god, a light! Civilization! Without hesitation, the taller male starts sprinting towards the light, hope returning to him. As he gets closer, through the maze of trees and snowflakes, he can see it's just one house. But that's all it takes. One person, just one person to bring Jacob back to life, one person to save the brunette when Jay's unable to.</p>
                <p>He makes it to the door, knocking loudly to make sure he's heard by anyone inside. Oh, please let there be someone inside. Please...</p>
                <p>The door opens, and a blurry figure appears. Jay can't quite make out what the figure is saying, it doesn't matter anyway. All that matters is "Save him..." He's run out of energy. He can't go on any longer. And as the world starts to get black and he feels the warm wooden floor against his cheek, all he can hope is that whoever opened that door has room in their heart to bring Jacob back to life.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>----------</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Warmth. Why is it so warm? Why is HE warm? He has to keep Jacob warm, he has to keep him alive long enough to-</p>
                <p>JACOB!</p>
                <p>The tall blonde comes back to consciousness with a start, quickly looking around at his surroundings. Where is he? Microscopes, books, and science equipment like the shelves where there should be family pictures. The walls looks worn down and old, yet still sturdy enough to stay standing. The couch he finds himself on sinks in under his weight, the fabric a little stiff and uncomfortable. In contrast, the blanket wrapped around him is fussy and soft, like a friendly hug.</p>
                <p>But most importantly...</p>
                <p>The familiar feel of Jacob's fingers running through his curly hair to soothe him as he tries to figure out where he is. The brunette softly pulls Jay back down so that his head lays in his lap, continuing to play with his hair to comfort him. "Shh, calm down, I'm right here. Everything is okay. This place is safe." He whispers as he wraps the blanket around the blonde again to keep him warm.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>That immediately puts Jay at ease. Jacob has a blanket around his shoulders as well, and in his free hand, he holds a cup of something steamy. He looks perfectly fine, better than fine if anything. Nothing could make Jay happier than knowing Jacob is safe. He succeeded in his goal. Now he can relax and curl up against the midget, a small smile making it's way onto his face.</p>
                <p>Jacob smiles brightly, taking a sip from that steamy cup before continuing to soothe the skittish boy. Soon enough, the owner of the house realizes Jay has finally woken up and decides to check and see how he's doing. The living room is set up so two couches are set facing each other, a coffee table in the middle. So, he takes a seat on the couch opposite the two boys. "How's he doing?" His voice is soft and gently, really just pleasing to listen to. Like the gentle whisper of a summer breeze.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>It doesn't matter how soft the guy's voice is though, Jay startles and jumps away from Jacob, sitting up quickly and holding a hand out. His pendant, a blue crystal on a coppery chain around his neck, starts to glow as a ball of blue light shoots out towards the other. Jacob tries to stop Jay, but he's too slow. "No, Jay, he's good! He's Sam, don't hurt him!"</p>
                <p>It's too late. This magical ball hits Sam and sends the poor guy flying into a wall. He just wanted to see how the man who fainted on his doorstep was doing. When Jacob tells the taller male who Sam is though, he immediately flips his aggressive introduction. "Oh, hi! :D" Even if Jay didn't mean for that to be insulting at all, that was just rubbing salt into the wounds.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob quickly runs over to make sure Sam is okay after setting his cup down on the coffee table, but the other manages to get up shakily, trying to ignore the pain. "I'm fine... I should've saw that one coming-" The younger male ignores Jacob's help as he hobbles back over to the fallen over couch. There's no way he's going to be able to flip it back over, so he doesn't bother trying, instead sitting down next to Jay. "You," he points to Jacob. "Get back to your seat. You shouldn't be running around yet." Then he looks to Jay. "Sorry for startling you, I didn't mean to. How do you feel? You've been out for a while."</p>
                <p>Jacob reluctantly goes back to his seat as Jay answers. "How long?"</p>
                <p>"A day or so. You also had severe hypothermia. So did Jacob. If you got here any later, he might have frozen." After a second, the younger male feels he might be coming onto strong and tries to bring it back a bit. "Sorry, I haven't even properly introduced myself to you. I'm Sam. Sam Broteez. And you are?"</p>
                <p>"A day?!" Jay starts getting worked up once again. "We can't be here for that long, they'll... They'll find us again..." He suddenly pulls Jacob into his arms, using the midget as a stuffed animal to hug tightly. "They'll... They'll..."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam sighs softly, shaking his head. "Jacob kept mentioning a 'They' too... You guys don't have to tell me who they are or what they did. You're safe here. I help people who are on the run or can't afford a hospital, nobody is going to find you here. You can stay as long as you want." He reassures, looking at the taller boy with complete sincerity and truthfulness. "I will not force you to say anything you don't want to, but if you want to talk about what happened, my door is always open. I will not force you to let me help you, but if you would allow me, I would like to bandage up some of those wounds you have so they can heal. Nobody is going to hurt you here."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jay hesitates. This guy is very hard not to want to trust. But he can't let his guard down. So he says nothing. His body does relax again at his words, but it's going to take a while for him to learn to trust someone else. And Sam will let Jay take all the time he needs.</p>

            <summary><h1>The Briefcase (Christmas Prompt)</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Lights twinkle around the house, little paper snowflakes skatter around the walls but not in a cluttered way. They're arranged in a very aesthetic way. A few handcrafted trinkets and Christmas themed items furnish the home. The scrawny boy was keeping himself busy, measuring a piece of wood before sawing into it. He was trying to create something that could impress his father. He will continue to craft both day and night if there's a chance that it'll make his father happy.</p>
                <p>Its not everyday that dad comes back. He's normally away on business trips for Christmas, so this is a great opportunity to make the best Christmas gift possible.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>One of his cats hops up onto the workbench and the boy has to shoo them away. "Two fifteen, go hang out with 3 o'clock, it's dangerous up here-" He has so many cats that he refers to them based on when they normally show up at his house. The only cat he truly owns is a white cat he named Noon as a play on naming black cats Midnight. All the other cats are strays that he lets in and takes care of when his father isn't around. They come and go as they please. </p>
                <p>The cat meows, ignoring his warning, trying to get the boys attention. His father is home. The cat heard a new human at the door.</p>
                <p>He puts the saw down to look at the cat. "What? Do you need food or something? I already fed yo--" He hears the front door's lock being fiddled with. He immediately jumps into action. Time to lead all the stray cats to the back door. He runs over to the living room. "Alright guys, we practiced this! Time to evacuate." At the word 'evacuate,' all the cats except for his permanent cat spring into action as well, bolting down the hall to the kitty door in the back, running outside. Yes, he trained the cats. That's how much free time he has. This whole routine is pointless for a specific reason, but the boy does it anyways.</p>
                <p>And they escaped just in time. The front door opens and the father saunters into the living room, tossing his keys down onto the coffee table before setting his briefcase down. "I see you've been busy at work, Ellie..." He does not seem pleased, sitting down on the couch and starting to take off his shoes so he can relax now that he's home.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Dad! What a surprise~" Elliot reaches up to take his hairband out, since he knows his father doesn't like him keeping his hair up like that. His hair is pretty long, going a few inches past his shoulders. "How was work? How long do you think you'll be staying?"</p>
                <p>The father sets his shoes aside and leans back against the couch, letting out a long sigh. "Probably not long, sorry bud. I can stay around for maybe two weeks if I'm lucky." He looks up at the ceiling, closing his eyes. "And you probably want to show me those things you made? You do know its pointless to make surprises right? I see everything you do." He gestures to one of the nearby cameras.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>This is why the evacuation thing was pointless. This house has 24/7 surveillance. To an extreme. Every room in this house, even the bathroom and a few blocks down the street, is being recorded. Every second of Elliot's life is on a hard drive.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"But, it's different when you see it in real life~!" His fathers negativity is not enough to get him down.</p>
                <p>But his positivity does not spread to his father. "Doubt it... But fine, show me your briefcase."</p>
                <p>Elliot happily runs off to his room to fetch the present he made for his father. It only takes a few seconds, then he runs back to the living room, proudly holding it out to his father. The thing he was working on earlier is a separate present. He makes his father multiple presents.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>It's a very useful briefcase. He had done some studying on how they work and made a bunch of blueprints to find ways to make them more efficient: ie. Lighter while still being able to carry the same amount, or utilizing more organization, or being able to store more for the same weight. Or all combined into one. He spent weeks drafting and redrafting designs for this. The final product is immaculate. Sleek and modern while bearing some personal touches, like his fathers name embossed in the well treated leather. And there are some fancy patterns engraved around the edges to add a more expensive look to it. It looks professional. And the inside of it is pretty similar to a normal briefcase, but it does have some differences to add more capabilities and functionality to it, based around the specific needs of his father. Not everyone uses them the same way, so they have to be more generic. But a specific person has a more specific style of use. So, Elliot can skew the functionality towards that.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Elliot... I have a briefcase."</p>
                <p>"I know, but... Just hold it, please?"</p>
                <p>The father reluctantly sits up to take the gift from Elliot, opening it up and inspecting it. "... You're going to be an entrepreneur one day."</p>
                <p>"That's the plan~!" Elliot smiles and hops onto the couch next to his father, just happy that he didn't totally reject the gift. Thats a win in his books. "One day I'm going to be just like you."</p>
                <p>"Good luck with that, kid..." The father sets the briefcase down next to his old one before sitting back against the couch again, gently placing an arm around Elliot. "You might be able to craft, but you have no spine."</p>
                <p>"I'll hire people to be my spine!"</p>
                <p>His father snorts for a second. "Alright, you do that~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Elliot smiles brightly and moves over to be closer to his father. Not exactly cuddling with him, they're not exactly the cuddling kind of family. That half hug his father gave him is very affectionate in terms of this family. "I should be able to have your other gift finished before you leave again."</p>
                <p>"You don't need to worry about that. You should be focusing your efforts on getting into a good college. And finding a way to pay for it."</p>
                <p>"I already have that covered~" Elliot shrugs. "Did you get anything for me?"</p>
                <p>"No, sorry."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Elliot may put all this effort in to make his father happy, but it will never be reciprocated.</p>

            <summary><h1>Christmas Tree (Christmas Prompt)</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger warning: Financial problems, alcoholism, mentions of suicide</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This was the best he could do. He tried his best. Sam just got done trying to create a makeshift Christmas tree. It looked a lot like that small Christmas tree from Charlie Brown. But... A lot worse- He made it out of paper. Simon's young though, he shouldn't care, right? The material objects aren't the point, the point of a holiday is to be with family.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam's still too young for employers to take him seriously, not to mention, he has murder on his crime record already. It was proven to be a false accusation, but its still on his record. Nobody wants to hire a child with murder record. He doesn't have the money to buy an actual tree or any ornaments. They can't have the luxury of decorating a tree together.</p>
                <p>Simon probably wouldn't even like decorating a tree anyway...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He sighs softly and sits down as he looks at the tree, barely able to stay standing on the kitchen table. That thing is going to topple over any second. Maybe he should just turn himself and Simon in to social services... They could have a real tree. And probably give him a better life than Sam has to offer.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Looking good, kid!" His fathers voice rings out, the words slurring together as the larger figure stumbles into the kitchen. Probably looking for another bottle of beer. "Wish I could offer you some cash, but..."</p>
                <p>"Yeah, yeah, mom gave it all away before offing herself. You could at least get a job..." The blonde grumbles, mostly to himself, grimacing at the disgusting smell surrounding his father. That guy could really benefit from taking a shower or brushing his teeth. And maybe vomiting less, that'd help too.</p>
                <p>"What did you say to me?" The father whips around to look at Sam.</p>
                <p>"Nothing, nothing, sorry." Sam adverts his gaze to the ground, folding his hands in his lap. "Do you need anything?"</p>
                <p>The man grumbles and pulls a fresh bottle of beer out of the fridge. "We're running low on beer..."</p>
                <p>"I'll add it to the shopping list."</p>
                <p>"Good. And uh... Sorry." After looking at the tree again, that pathetic looking tree, he feels a little bad for yelling at Sam. "For how things are..." He hesitates before awkwardly patting Sam on the back. Then he stumbles back into the living room to collapse on the couch.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The young boy nods, biting his bottom lip to keep himself from crying. That's literally the nicest thing his father has said to him for a few years now. And that fact in itself stings.</p>
                <p>He then feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. He quickly takes it out to see what it was. Jacob sent him a message: "Mind if I stop by?"</p>
                <p>It takes him a few moments to respond. He's still ashamed to have anyone stop by the house, its a wreck, his father is a mess, and Simon is probably destroying something, but its nothing Jacob hasn't already seen. "Sure."</p>
                <p>"Good, cuz I'm already here :&#41;"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>That gets a faint smile out of the blonde. He gets up, making his way to the front door. When he opens it, he finds Jacob standing outside in a puffy jacket and a scarf, holding a small plastic tree in his hands. On of those tiny, one foot tall trees you can find at Walmart or Target. The brunette has a big smile on his face, just like always. "I saw you trying to plan out what looked like one of these during lunch the other day, so I thought I'd get you one."</p>
                <p>Sam doesn't know what to say, so he just runs up to pull Jacob into a tight hug. Jacob is a little taller than him, so he does have to reach up to be able to do so. "Thank you... I just..."</p>
                <p>"I know, I know. This is the price of being able to feed everyone for a day, so you didn't want to buy it." Jacob sets the tree down on the front step before hugging Sam back. "You still deserve to have a good Christmas though." It always pains him to see the kid killing himself to give his family everything he can. A child shouldn't have to do that. He will always try to help alleviate some of that stress. "By the way... I also saw you didn't have a heavy jacket... I'm wearing two jackets right now, one is for you. Amd don't say that you don't take handouts. This is not a handout! This is the Christmas spirit~" Great excuse. Probably the only season he'll be able to get Sam to accept gifts during.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The blonde chuckles a little and lets go of Jacob, not wanting him to overheat or anything now that he knows more information. "I did give my jacket to Simon. He started preschool, I didn't want him getting sick." He picks up the tree before gesturing for Jacob to follow him inside. "Would you like anything to drink?"</p>
                <p>Jacob follows him inside, shutting the door behind himself before taking off his jackets. "No, thats fine. You don't have to worry about tha--" He sees the paper tree. "Thats adorable~"</p>
                <p>"Oh, shut up~ It's going in the trash now."</p>
                <p>"No, it most certainly is not! Do not throw that out! Its the cutest thing ever! Quality doesn't matter, look at how much effort you put into it."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam rolls his eyes, setting the new tree down on the table. "If you want it, you can have it. I just didn't want one of the first Christmases Simon will be able to remember to not have a tree."</p>
                <p>"Adorable~" He lays the jackets over the back of one of the kitchen chairs. "I think I will take it if you don't want it. You put a lot of thought into it."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Go ahead." Even though he's acting like he doesn't care, that does mean a lot to him. Someone is appreciating his efforts. Someone notices, someone cares. "Is there anything else you came over for?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Can... Can you help me with math?"</p>

            <summary><h1>The Fog</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger Warning - Drug Addiction, Depression</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>"Yeah, like you could understand... I'm not saying what you went through is easier, it is not, I know that. But that doesn't mean you understand exactly what I go through." The angel mutters as he goes back to filing out some paperwork, not in the mood to put up with Jay's crap.</p>
                <p>"Yes I can."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>God, Jay is so annoying. How can he say that so matter-of-factly? Yeah, yeah, he probably doesn't realize how rude that was, but c'mon, stuff like that hurts! How is it fair that he always gets to play the "sorry, trauma, me no know how to human" card?</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"You're trying to navigate a pitch black, foggy night. There's no light in sight, just endless darkness. You do have a flashlight, but when you try to use it, because it's so foggy, the light ends up making it harder to see, so you opt to live in the darkness. Alone. With no end in sight."</p>
                <p>Sam's heart stops briefly as he freezes.... Stupid Jay and his metaphors...</p>
                <p>"I don't have the fog. So when Jacob showed up, blindingly bright, I could see. But you're trapped in the fog. And when Jacob tries to help and light the way, it just makes it harder to navigate, so you isolate yourself."</p>
                <p>"And what are you in the metaphor? Are you not another light doing the exact same thing?" Sam puts his pen down and looks up at the taller male sat across from him. He doesn't mean that in an offensive way, he just doesn't know where Jay fits in his own metaphor. It's clear to Sam that the fog in Jay's analogy is depression. Jay's not depressed, Sam is. And when someone tries to help, it tends to trigger that and he ends up trying to isolate himself.</p>
                <p>He shakes his head. "Nothing."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Alright, that wasn't helpful. "What are you trying to say?"</p>
                <p>"You need help."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob put him up to this. Jacob put him up to this. There's no way. "I'm not going to therapy! I have medicine, that's good enough." Sam shakes his head and picks up his pen again to get back to work.</p>
                <p>"That just helps stop the thunderstorm. I agree, without the medicine, it's much harder. With all the crashing bangs of lightning, it's scary and you might feel like giving up a lot faster. But you know your storm has grown out of control."</p>
                <p>Now, even Jay is calling him out for being a drug addict... But he's not wrong...No, no, he doesn't need therapy, he's fine!"And how come you don't need help?"</p>
                <p>"They'll think I'm crazy. I hear voices and see things because of the pendant. They won't believe me."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Fair enough. They also might not even be able to handle Jay... And that pendant would surely get mad at the mere consideration of therapy. It might not be an option for Jay.The angel sighs softly and puts the pen down again to look back to Jay."Why are you really telling me all of this? Why were you asking about if I needed anything in the first place?"</p>
                <p>"The pendant told me you didn't sleep last night."</p>
                <p>Sam can't help but chuckle a little bit at that. "Okay, so, the pendant tells you I didn't sleep one night, you go on a huge rant about depression, just to tell me I need therapy, because I didn't sleep?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"... Yes." Jay says, like that was a completely normal chain of events.</p>
                <p>"Okay, okay, fair enough." He smiles a little and decides to open up, since that whole thing was Jay's way of saying that he's worried. "I'm okay. The wolves were active last night, and it reminded me of my sister. So, I decided to spend the night watching YouTube to drown out the noise of the wolves howling. It's not because I'm at risk of going into a depressive episode." He explains in a softer tone. "Would you like to spend the night with me so you can make sure?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jay nods.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Alright, you can join me in bed tonight." The angel spreads out one of his wings before gesturing for the taller boy to join him on the same couch. "C'mon, you can cuddle if you want to." He knows that physical affection is one of the major ways that Jay is able to communicate how he really feels. He can wrap a wing around Jay and still be able to work.</p>
                <p>Of course, Jay takes that opportunity right away, no hesitation. Sam wraps his wing around Jay. The guy might be tall, but the wing can still wrap around him. Those wings are huge.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Since that should be enough to satisfy Jay and keep him happy for a while, Sam makes ANOTHER attempt at resuming his work, picking up the pen and starting to fill things out. But he's interrupted again, this time because he feels Jay running a hand down his wing, getting him to let out a surprised giggle. He assumes Jay just wanted to be able to feel how soft the feathers were though. "Jahahay, don't touch my wings like that."</p>
                <p>"But it can clear the fog temporarily."</p>
                <p>Sam quickly shakes his head. "Jay, no. The fog is fine! You can't fix depression that easily you know, it's not that simple of a probl--EHEM! Jahahay!" He laughs softly and tries to push Jay away, but Jay has his wing trapped, and he's not strong enough to push Jay away.</p>
                <p>"I said temporarily-" Jay gently holds Sam's wing in place, using his free hand to softly mess around with the feathers. "You probably thought Jacob told me to say the therapy thing, he didn't. He told me to do this~ He wasn't happy when I said you didn't sleep~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"You toLD hihihim?!" Sam hugs himself as he giggles, since he knows there's no way he's going to be able to get away from Jay. He can see how that conversation went though. Jay probably went to Jacob with his concerns and how he wanted to talk to Sam to see what's up, and Jacob agreed but added that he would like it if Jay wrecked Sam to make sure the message got across. That's probably what went down. And then Sam went ahead and gave Jay the opportunity.</p>
                <p>Jay lets Sam's wing go so he can pull the angel onto his lap and trap him in a hug, gently scribbling his fingers along his sides. "Of course. I wasn't sure if it was normal for people to skip sleep."</p>
                <p>When Jay gets you in this position, you know you're screwed. This tends to be his preferred way of tickling someone, since it is a more affectionate way than pinning them on the ground or something, but it's also harder to fight back.Sam squeaks and quickly tries to escape the hug, but it's no use. At least Jay tends to be very soft. "It ihihis! Sohohometimes you just hahahave a bad nihihight, ihihit's not thehehe end of the wohohorld!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Well, I told Jacob I would do this. I have to follow through~" Jay shrugs, slipping his hands under Sam's shirt. "And it is nice to see you shine every once and a while."</p>
                <p>Back to the metaphors! But Sam can't really think about that one too much, he's too busy giggle and squirming around in Jay's hold. He gives up trying to talk his way out of this, just curling up against Jay in a giggly mess.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Eventually, Jay does stop, now just hugging Sam. "You can't tell me the fog hasn't been lifted temporarily~"</p>
                <p>Sam nods, still giggling softly as he just rests. Obviously you can't cure depression, but he's definitely not sad right now, and there are no depressive thoughts clouding his mind. "Ihihi was fine befohore-"</p>
                <p>"But now you're better!" Jay nuzzles Sam softly, clearly in a better mood as well now. He was in a better mood the second Sam offered to let him cuddle though.</p>

            <summary><h1>The Perfect Test Subject</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger Warning: Gore, abuse, kidnap</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Jacob lies in the concrete cell, waiting for Jay to be brought back. He still doesn't understand what the point of this entire place is. This is the second time they've been stuck in this cell. They escaped once before, but... Were they ever truly free?</p>
                <p>His thoughts are stopped in their tracks as the cell door opens and the blonde is shoved into the cell before the door shuts again. His necklace is glowing enough to illuminate the room in a red tint. His frail body does not look like it can withstand much more abuse. Yet, the man looks completely fine. At least, his expression. He still looks as dead as ever, uninterested in anything. Despite being covered in fresh wounds and blood.</p>
                <p>The cell they're in has no furniture or anything, its just a concrete box with a jail-like door and one jail-like window thats a little too high for Jacob to be able to see out of. All it does is let the cold night air inside.</p>
                <p>By now, Jacob has learned not to bother trying to talk to Jay. The guy just won't respond, at all. He wants to talk, but he knows that could get both of them in trouble.</p>
                <p>The taller male picks himself up from off the floor, sitting up. Normally, he would go straight back to his corner in the cell to start drawing in his sketchbook again, but this time, he doesn't. He reaches up and takes the necklace off. The chain burns his hand when he touches it, leaving a scar across his palm. He quickly tosses the necklace aside. He then looks up at the brunette, opening his mouth to say something, and then giving up.</p>
                <p>Jacob quickly sits up, extremely intrigued. "It's okay. I'm listening. Do you want to write it out on paper?" He's not sure if the guy even knows how to talk.</p>
                <p>The blonde shakes his head, taking a few minutes to compose himself. Jacob gives him as much time as he needs. He's already given the guy three years, he can wait longer. "I-I... I..." His voice is very quiet and anxious. He can't look Jacob in the eyes as he speaks, he just stares at the ground. "I'm the r-reason m-magic... exists... A-And they w-want to reverse i-it..."</p>
                <p>Jacob wants to hug Jay or comfort him in some way, but he doesn't want to invade his personal space, so he resists the urge. "What do you mean?"</p>
                <p>Jay takes a deep breath. This is very difficult for him. This is his first real conversation. Ever. "T-The particle... I-It was supp-pose to make mag-gic possible. B-but they messed up. S-so they need a cure. And t-they can't do t-that without access t-to the s-source of magic i-in the first pl-place-"</p>
                <p>"... Okay... So, I don't want to make you uncomfortable, alright? But... May I hug you? You seem like you could use it. Thank you for opening up to me, and you don't need to explain it all right now, unless you want to. It may take me some time to fully understand it al--"</p>
                <p>"Wh-what's a hug?" Jay looks back up at the smaller male, unsure if he should accept his offer. Though, that uncertainty doesn't show in his expression, just his eyes.</p>
                <p>Jacob hesitates for a moment before getting up and walking over to be closer to Jay. He's careful to be slow as he moves, not wanting to startle him at all. Then he sits next to him. "What I'm about to do is not meant to hurt you. And if you don't like it, you can push me away. I just want to show you what a hug is. I don't mean to force you into anything or make you uncomfortable." He explains, and once he makes sure he doesn't get any negative body language in response from Jay, he spreads his arms out and hugs Jay. Gently.</p>
                <p>Jay tenses up a lot, the physical touch reminding him of abuse at first. But after a second, he tries his best to reciprocate. Its not the best, he doesn't understand how to hug. But he's trying. Jacob smiles a little and holds Jay close, careful not to hurt him at all. "Why do they need you in particular?"</p>
                <p>"T-The pendant wo-wont let me die. I'm th-the perfe-fect test subject."</p>
                <p>"What abo--" Jacob starts to ask another question, but then Jay suddenly pulls him onto his lap and puts a hand over his mouth to make him be quiet as he stares at the door. He heard something outside and didn't want Jacob to get punished for speaking. Jacob does shut up for now, just taking the opportunity to cuddle into Jay's warmth a little. Once Jay lowers his hand back down, Jacob tries to continue. "Why won't it let you die? Don't you control it?"</p>
                <p>Jay doesn't answer. He's done talking. That guard walking by outside scared him off from reaching out for now. Its not long before Jacob realizes this. "Thank you for telling me. It means a lot~" He smiles and rests his head on Jays chest. "Mind if I stay here tonight? You're really warm..." He asks a bit quieter now, to which Jay just nods.</p>

            <summary><h1>You're not Alone</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger warning: mention of rape</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The statement lingers in the air.</p>
                <p>The two boys look at each other in silence.</p>
                <p>'You're not alone.'</p>
                <p>Those simple words made Jay go completely silent.</p>
                <p>Jacob is too scared to say anything else or to even move, worried he somehow messed up. He watches that stupid necklace Jay has start to glow and turn red. The only sound in the entire forest at this moment is the sizzling of that necklace against the blonde's skin, burning into his chest. It pierces through the silence.</p>
                <p>What is going through Jay's mind? It's impossible to tell. There is no emotion in his expression or composure. The only hint to what's really going on is the touch of sadness in his eyes. Those beautiful electric blue eyes. The one thing that will always give him away.</p>
                <p>It feels like an eternity, just sitting there in the forest, waiting for some sort of reaction. Even if he can't detect any emotions from Jay, the shorter male can tell that he needs to wait for something.</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>Tears.</p>
                <p>Tears start to form in Jay's eyes. Jacob immediately scrambles over to pull the taller male into a tight hug, climbing onto his lap. "You don't need to explain yourself, I love you. It's good to be upset, it's healthy. An--"</p>
                <p>Jay quickly takes off his necklace and tosses it aside. The flower the necklace landed on shrivels up and burns to a crisp.</p>
                <p>And just like that, Jay's entire composure collapses. He holds onto Jacob tightly as he breaks down sobbing, everything coming out at once. The necklace acts like a dam, everything was building up over time and once the dam is removed, it all pours out in a tidal wave of emotions.</p>
                <p>Jacob smiles a little and just snuggles into Jay. "Take your time." It may seem strange to smile when your boyfriend suddenly starts sobbing, but it's actually not. Jacob knows that this might be one of the first times Jay has EVER cried, and thats not healthy. Crying helps relieve stress, and it is good for the body. It is good to release all that tension. Jacobs not going to try to make Jay stop, he's just going to be there. And wait. Sometimes that's all someone needs.</p>
                <p>"I-It was... every we-week-" Jay tries to explain as he squeezes Jacob as if the smaller male were a teddy bear. "E-every w-w-week... in t-that... be-ed... F-For... I don't un-underst-stand ti-time..."</p>
                <p>The brunette looks up at Jay, gently wiping away some of his tears with his thumb, not caring that more will just replace it. "Jay, you were very small in those drawings you showed me. You can safely say it was years."</p>
                <p>"O-Oka-ay..." Jay gently pushes Jacobs hand away. And Jacob just accepts that, no need to push his boundaries accidentally when Jay is talking about being taken advantage of.</p>
                <p>"You don't have to explain if you don't want to. You can if you want, and I will listen, but do not feel like it is an obligation or anything." Jacob clarifies as he goes back to simply snuggling into Jay's hold. The blonde nods, not saying anything else, just crying.</p>
                <p>Several minutes go by before Jay starts to calm back down, now just sniffling a little as his grip on Jacob loosens so he's not accidentally crushing the guy. "Th-Thank you..."</p>
                <p>"You don't need to thank me. I'm here for you, no matter what. I'm perfectly fine being your personal teddy bear if you need it~" That gets the slightest hint of a smile out of Jay. "And I know you would do the same for me. You're not alone." He looks up at Jay. "What do you want to do now? We can cuddle and talk about everything and nothing for the rest of the day if you want, or we can do something to get your mind off things, it's up to you."</p>
                <p>Jay tightens his hold on Jacob slightly.</p>
                <p>"Cuddle? Perfectly fine with me~"</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>"No, try again. You're really close! 8 divided by 4 isn't 4, so how about we try thinking about it again?" Sam was sat next to Jacob on a nice couch, helping him with some math homework. The blonde always makes sure to try to help the other not get too frustrated with the work. That is a big part of tutoring, understanding that the people you're helping can get very frustrated. It's not the tutors fault, don't take it personally. When someone can't grasp a concept, thats frustrating. So, Sam always tries his best to make sure the brunette doesn't get too mad at himself.</p>
                <p>Jacob just groans and leans against Sam, whining quietly. "I don't want to... Can't we just play Mario Kart or something?"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head. "No, you're not going to convince or bribe me again. You're the one paying for this session! Don't throw your money away like that."</p>
                <p>The brunette rolls his eyes. "Yeah, says the rich kid... Couldn't you just give me sessions for free? Then we won't have that problem. You're not doing this for the money."</p>
                <p>That makes the blonde go quiet for a few moment, which makes Jacob's heart sink as he wonders if he said something wrong. "If... If you don't have the incentive of staying to get your money's full worth, you'll leave..."</p>
                <p>His heart sinks further down. "Sammy..." He sighs softly and pulls the younger male into a gentle hug. "You're too adorable to leave~" He ruffles his hair playfully, making him giggle and little and try to bat Jacob's hands away.</p>
                <p>"I'm not adorable!"</p>
                <p>"You can't say that after giggling like that~" He ruffles his hair again, just to see him act cute again.</p>
                <p>Sam giggles and this time just squirms out of Jacob's hug, picking up his pencil again. "Stop that, my hair is a mess to begin with!" He has a point. His hair is always just a ball of fluff on top of his head. But that's why Jacob likes messing with him like that. "You're trying to distract me again. It's not going to work. Now, what is 8 divided by 4?" He crosses his arms, trying his darndest to act professional. It just looks cute for an eight year old though.</p>
                <p>The older male smiles and reaches out to try to pry the younger males arms apart, accidentally brushing his hand against his side. Sam giggles a little again and pushes Jacob away. "I said it's not going to work!"</p>
                <p>Why did Sam giggle that time? With the hair ruffling, Jacob normally assumed it was just because Sam perceived it as a playful form of affection and that it was more of an embarrassed / nervous little giggle. But that one... That's not the same. Jacob tilts his head to the side as he thinks, squinting his vivid blue eyes at Sam. Until suddenly, his eyes open wide with realization as the scene replays in his mind. "Are you ticklish?!"</p>
                <p>Sam's bright green eyes widen too as the tips of his ears turn a slight shade of pink. He quickly shakes his head. "No-... W-we need to get back to work..."</p>
                <p>Nothing is going to be able to make Jacob think about anything else now however. A grin slowly pulls at his lips as he stares at the ever nervous boy in front of him. "I think you are~"</p>
                <p>The smaller boy looks up at Jacob, starting to giggle softly again from the simple accusation. "Noho I'm nohOT!" He quickly tosses his pencil down onto the table and jumps up to his feet to back away as Jacob makes an attempt to lunge at him. "Stay back!"</p>
                <p>The grin on Jacob's face just widens as he starts to giggle as well. "You better run, nerd! I don't like liars~!"</p>
                <p>Sam's face tinges a slight shade of pink, matching his ears now as giggles continue to slip past his lips. He doesn't need to hear that threat more than once, he makes a run for it. And Jacob is quick to get up and chase after him. The younger boy does not last that long before the other manages to jump and tackle him down to the ground, though he is careful not to hurt the blonde at all. "Gotcha!"</p>
                <p>Even before Jacob does anything to him, this adorable and carefree laughter pours out of Sam as he tries to squirm away from the older boy. "Nohohoho! Dohohohohon't!"</p>
                <p>It is impossible not to laugh along with Sam to an extent. His laughter is just so bubbly and adorable, its music to Jacob's ears. "Yohohou must be really ticklish, I'm not even touching you~" He teases playfully as he slowly pushes Sam's t-shirt up, which of course makes the blonde laugh and giggle more, fighting to try and block Jacob. "You're not getting out of this I'm afraid. You have made me really curious~ I’m gonna need to find all of your giggle spots. Unless you wanna help me so it can go by faster. Or do you WANT me to go slowly?”</p>
                <p>Sam just giggles and shakes his head to the best of his ability. Jacob was barely doing anything and Sam was already in pieces. This is going to be so much fun.</p>
                <p>“No? Okay then, guess I’ll have to find all of them myself. I’m gonna have to tickle here, and squeeze there, oh, and I have to claw this little area.”</p>
                <p>With every word, Jacob did that motion with a random spot on Sam's torso. First it was his ribs, then his sides, then his tummy. Every touch produces the cutest reactions from Sam. The younger male kicks his legs gently and balls his hands up into lil' fists as he laughs and rolls around, unable to get away from Jacob's ticklish grasp. "Stohahahahap! Nohoho, nohohot thehehehere! Ehehehe~! Jahahahacohohohob! Thihihihis ihihihsn't produhuhuhuctiHIHIHIVE!" He lets out an adorable squeal before quickly clamping his hands over his mouth to muffle the sound. Jacob had gotten to his hips.</p>
                <p>"I thought you weren't ticklish, little man, why should I stop~? I think this is very productive. I get to teach you not to lie, and, I get to find a giggle spot like this~!" After seeing Sam's reaction, Jacob starts to squeeze his hips a few times and dig his thumbs into them gently.</p>
                <p>This drives the blonde crazy. He laughs loudly and flails about wildly. Jacob wouldn't be surprised if any neighbors got concerned when hearing Sam scream and laugh like this. "NOHO, JAHAHAKE, IHI--" He doesn't even finish his sentence, he just laughs more, squeezing his eyes tight, as if not being able to see the tickles will make it any better. But that means he doesn't see Jacob suddenly switch spots, he just feels the other gently skitter one of his hands over his neck, making him let out another squeal before dissolving into more laughter as he tries to scrunch his shoulders up.</p>
                <p>"You are so sensitive! How did I never realize before? I could've made you play with me without using cupcakes as a bribe this whole time!" Jacob giggles and stops targeting those spots, not wanting to be too mean to Sam. But he is having so much fun making him laugh like this, he's loving every second of this.</p>
                <p>Sam's laughter starts to die back down to a mixture of laughter and giggles, his face a bit red from laughing like that before. "Dohoho nohohot uhuhuse thihihis aghahainst mehehehe-!"</p>
                <p>And just then, the front door opens. Jacob pauses for a moment and looks up, watching as Sam's father walks in. His father is a nice looking fellow, but the guy definitely seems confused by seeing Jacob pinning the giggly mess known as Sam down on the floor.</p>
                <p>"... He's teaching me how to add. See, 3 plus 2 is one, two, three... four, five~!" Jacob comes up with an excuse, counting to three with Sam's left ribs, and adding the other two with the right. The blonde squeaks and giggles more, now blushing like crazy since his father is witnessing this. But thats definitely a better explanation than anything Sam would be able to come up with in this state.</p>
                <p>His father smiles a little. Jacob is obviously lying, but its not everyday that he sees Sam that happy around someone his age. "I think you'd be able to get to higher numbers if you used his fingers or toes~" Is all he says before leaving the two kids alone, making his way to his office.</p>
                <p>Jacob looks down at Sam with a grin.</p>
                <p>Sam quickly shakes his head. "H-hehey now, Ihihi'm proud you actually gohohot the rihihight answer there, but dohohon't you dahahahare-"</p>
                <p>"Sorry, but that was a suggestion from your father, I'm not going to ignore that~!" The brunette says playfully before turning around and gently taking Sam's socks off. Sam is quick to try to pull his legs away and curl his toes defensively, but he can't get away from Jacob. "Now, how ticklish are these? How about this? Oh, and these definitely deserve a good scratching~" He starts to explore Sam's feet, testing out to see where's most ticklish. To begin with, he targets Sam's soles, arches, and heels.</p>
                <p>That's enough to get the blonde to descend into bubbly giggles again, wiggling his feet around to try to avoid Jacob's hands. And Jacob does have fun with just that. But eventually, he does have to at least try it...</p>
                <p>He gently holds Sam's toes back with one hand, using the other to scribble his fingers along the stems.</p>
                <p>"JAHAHAHACOB! NAHAHAHA! Ehehehehe!" Sam tosses his head back as he starts laughing again, hugging himself as he laughs. "Cuhuhuhut ihihit ohohout~!"</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly and does stop. He's had his fun. He gets off Sam and offers him a hand to help him up. "You are so adorable~ I love hearing you laugh."</p>
                <p>Sam takes some time to get himself back together, still giddy and smiling like a madman. "Yohohou're a mean poopyhead~" He takes Jacob's hand... And pulls him back down, suddenly pouncing on him.</p>
                <p>Jacob is taken aback, but he just smiles and lets the smaller boy have this moment. "I'm sorry, but unlike you, I find this fun~"</p>
                <p>"So do I. Just not when you're mean." So Sam was actually fine with that whole thing, he found it fun. Even though he fought back so much.</p>
                <p>Jacob can't help the giant smile on his face as he reaches up and hugs Sam close to his chest, slipping his hands under his shirt and spidering them up and down his sides, trapping the blonde in a tickly hug.</p>
                <p>Sam, even though he had managed to get on top of Jacob, ends up not having the upper hand as he collapses into a fit of giggles again. "Nohoho! Jahahacob!" He curls up in Jacob's arms, squirming around and kicking his legs softly. "Thihihis stihihihill ihihihsn't produhuhuhuctihihive!"</p>
                <p>"We got enough math done, I'm perfectly fine spending the rest of our hour having fun~ We only have a few minutes left anyway~"</p>

            <summary><h1>The Subject of The Sentence</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Jacob stares at the sentences in front of him. 'The dog ran after the ball.' What is the object of the sentence...</p>
                <p>Sam was patiently giving Jacob some time to think, swinging his legs back and forth over the edge of the couch. "What is the action word being applied to?" He asks, giving the brunette a hint.</p>
                <p>He thinks for another few moments. Action word... ran? Who's doing the running... "The dog?"</p>
                <p>"Yes!" Sam smiles brightly as Jacob gets the answer right. "The dog is doing the running."</p>
                <p>"Just like I'm always the one doing the tickling~" Jacob says that purely just to get a reaction out of Sam.</p>
                <p>And it works, the tips of Sam's ears turn a bit pink. "I never should have used that example..."</p>
                <p>"But it helps! Seriously!" Jacob says with a small laugh. As crazy as that sounds, its the truth. "I don't know why, but it really does help me."</p>
                <p>The blonde rolls his eyes. "That's because its something you enjoy and something you can relate to. And thats why I used it as an example. I just didn't think about the consequences of that example... I was just trying to quickly come up with something you liked, and--" He was starting to speak a little too fast for Jacob to be able to understand him. The rest of what he was trying to say just sounds like a string of unrelated sounds. Sometimes it really seems like this kids brain is working faster than his body can handle, he can't get the words out fast enough to keep up with his own mind.</p>
                <p>Jacob just waits for the younger, hyperactive boy to finish his unintelligible sentence, smiling. He always finds it cute when Sam gets a little too into talking about or explaining a topic. "Hey Sam, I know I brought it up a few weeks ago, but I was thinking... Can I stop paying for these sessions?"</p>
                <p>Sam looks like Jacob just stabbed him in the heart.</p>
                <p>"I just want to be your friend. And I know you're not doing this for the money, you are spoiled rich~ You just wanted someone to talk to. I like you, I really like you. And, I don't want to stop having the ability to hang out with you just because I can't afford tutoring anymore."</p>
                <p>"... Are you struggling financially?"</p>
                <p>"A little..." The brunette sheepishly puts his pencil down on the table. "And tutoring is one of the non-essential costs." He really can't tell if Sam even picked up on the 'I like you, I really like you' part. That part was an attempt at a confession, it seems to have failed.</p>
                <p>"... I guess this can be for free." Sam goes back to smiling now, no longer hurt by the possibility of Jacob leaving. "But don't take that to mean you can just fool around the whole time. I still want you to increase your grades."</p>
                <p>"I mess with you the whole time regardless~" Jacob loves getting reactions out of Sam. Everything about him is just so adorable. His laugh, his smile, the way he gets overly excited about certain science topics, the way he tries and totally fails to look tough when he's pouting, the fact that he's so dang innocent and naive... Jacob takes every opportunity he can to see Sam break that 'professional' composure. "Speaking of which, can we play Mario Kart? I don't want to work anymore right now~"</p>
                <p>Sam sighs softly and shakes his head. "No, I'm not going to be persuaded again. You need to work on--- Ee! Jahahacohohob!"</p>
                <p>The brunette had pulled Sam into a hug quickly to trap him as he starts to spider his fingers up Sam's sides. The blonde squeaks and dissolves into a fit of giggles, kicking his legs softly as he tries and fails to get away from Jacob's hold. "What was that~? I think I heard an 'oh, that's a great idea'~? Is that right?"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head. "Nohoho!" He attempts to stand his ground, but it doesn't last very long. As soon as Jacob trails a hand down to squeeze his hips, he breaks. "NOHO! Okahahahay, okahay, yohohou wihihihin!"</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly and lets Sam go, happy with that answer. "Thats what I thought~" Ever since he found out how ticklish Sam is, he's been using it against the kid all the time. And it works every time.</p>

            <summary><h1>What if I can't make you happy?</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger warning: Depression/Suicide</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It was 4:30 in the afternoon. Jacob was at the hospital, visiting his best friend, Sam. He's been beside Sam's bedside day in and day out after school for the last week. The doctors say Sam will be able to be released in a few days, they just need to keep him under watch a little longer to make sure the new medicine is working. It's been almost a year since Jacob last saw a real smile on Sam's face, it's always fake.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He watched Sam's life spiral out of control and did nothing about it... What idiot wou—</p>
                <p>No. He's here now, and that's what matters. Sam's not dead, it's not too late to turn things around.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Hey," Jacob says quietly as he takes a seat in the chair beside the white bed.</p>
                <p>Of course, the green-eyed blonde on the bed is busy trying to catch up on schoolwork he missed. "Greetings and salutation." His voice is soft and warm, while Jacob's has more energy and emotion. "Would have never guessed that you would come."</p>
                <p>Jacob chuckles softly at that, shaking his head, his caramel brown hair falling in his face. "I miss you! I have no one bribe with cupcakes to go play Mario Kart with me anymore!"</p>
                <p>Giving Jacob a weak smile, Sam shrugs, scribbling down numbers on his math homework which lay scattered about on the bed. He's also sitting in an odd position — he's sitting on one leg while the other one is up, his arm resting on it. It's like a half-kneel, half-hugging-knees-to-chest pose. "I'm sure you could find someone..."</p>
                <p>"Not-uh! I don't have to bride anyone else with cupcakes to play with me! It's not the same..." He sticks his bottom lip out, pouting.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He misses those days... What ever happened to them? The days when he'd text Sam to come over and play something, and when he refused, Jacob would go whip up a batch of cupcakes, and just like that, Sam would change his mind. The days when they would joke around and laugh for hours. The days when Jacob would randomly mention something that happens to spark Sam's interest and end up having to wait ten minutes while Sam goes on some nerd tangent about H. H. Holmes and Daniel Hudson Burnham and the Ferris wheel!</p>
                <p>Why didn't he DO anything when those times stopped happening... Why didn't he make the connection...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Sam...?" The midget looks at Sam with sad blue eyes.</p>
                <p>"Yeah?"</p>
                <p>"Was there anything I could have done? If I had stood up for you, tried to help, walked with you to school, spent more time with you... Would you still have jumped? I'm sorry, I just... I can't stop thinking about it..."</p>
                <p>Sam puts his pencil down, collecting his papers into a stack and putting them into a folder, which he then sets to the side, turning to face Jacob. "You did nothing wrong, Jacob. You don't need to worry about me, I'm fine now. Asking yourself what if's is only going to make you feel terrible. I don't know what would have happened if things were different, I... I don't know... I don't know anything..."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob gets up and runs on over to Sam, almost knocking him over as he hugs him tightly. "I'm... I'm scared, Sam..."</p>
                <p>"I know, but we're going to get through this, alright?" Sam put his leg down so its easier for him to hug Jacob as well, softly rubbing his back. "Together." He gives Jacob a reassuring smile, which only makes his stomach turn sharply.</p>
                <p>"When was the last time you were genuinely happy? What if I can't cheer you up? Sam, I don't want to lose you again, but I... I don't know how to stop you!"</p>
                <p>"You're not going to lose me. I saw her up there... Lindsey. I'm not going to try to do anything stupid again, I promise. I can't support Simon if I'm not here."</p>
                <p>"But what's the point of living if you're not happy?! I couldn't make you happy before, why would I be able to now?" The older male buries his head against the blonde, fighting back tears.</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head, holding him close. "Sure you can~! You could before, what are you talking about? That's your specialty~ Annoying people and magically putting a smile on their face."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob lets out a surprised laugh, now softly pushing Sam and shaking his head. "Wow, thanks! Putting annoying before the positive trait, because clearly, that's more prominent~!"</p>
                <p>"Exactly~ Glad your simple mind could process that~" This was the most outgoing thing Sam has said in a long time. The last time he said anything like that, he— Wait a minute...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Suddenly, the midget pounces on the nerd, pushing his shirt up and scribbling his fingers along Sam's exposed stomach. And then, something wonderful happens. Something magical. Oh, Jacob's heart is going to explode he's so happy! Sam falls into a fit of giggles, and my god, Jacob can feel his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
                <p>Sam tried to hold back his laughter, but Jacob took him by surprise, he had no time to prepare. "JAHACOHOB! Thihis ihisn't whahahat Ihi meheheheant!" He tosses his head back, trying to push the little guy off him, but he's not the strongest person out there. He's a nerd. Nerds aren't known for being strong or fast.</p>
                <p>"You sure about that, Sammy~? Guess that's just what my simple mind could process~" Jacob could not be smiling any wider than he already is, cherishing the smile on Sam's face. But something's different about it this time. His laughter used to be more infectious and recognizable... Now... Now his laughter is almost silent. It's kind of cute, making Jacobs' heart flutter. Sam's laughter goes completely silent when Jacob starts to dig his fingers into Sam's ribs, making him kick his legs around and squirm around helplessly.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Twenty, maybe thirty minutes go by before Jacob finally stops, blowing one last raspberry onto Sams' stomach to get one last adorable squeal out of him. After that, he just lets him catch his breath and calm down, lying down on the bed next to him, grinning like an idiot, letting out a satisfied sigh. "We gotta do that more often!"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head, curling up into a ball, a giggly mess beside Jacob. He may try to deny it, but as much as he hates to admit it, that was pretty fun... More fun than he's had in a while...</p>
                <p>And every day from then on, until Sam got released from the hospital, the first thing Jacob would do when he went to see Sam was tickling the heck out of him, leaving him in a giddy mood for the rest of the day. Sam almost misses being in the hospital — Almost. It still sucked in there when Jacob wasn't around.</p>

            <summary><h1>Wings</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This is wrong. Where did they come from? Is he crazy? He must be hallucinating.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>A huge pair of wings are spread out behind Sam as he stares in the mirror. Wings that look to be almost 11 feet long each. Angel wings. But he's not an angel, this can't be right.</p>
                <p>He neglects his little brother, he can't keep a non-shady job, everyone hates him, he's a failure, he's not an angel! So where did these wings come from? Even if God decided he was worthy, WHERE DID THE WINGS COME FROM? How did they just appear overnight? This can't be a mutation, people only get one mutation, and he already has one. So how did this happen?</p>
                <p>How is he going to hide them? He looks ridiculous with these things. What is he, an angelic businessman? That sounds like something straight out of a cartoon.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Jacob?" The blonde calls out, leaning over his dresser as he stares in the mirror. "I... I have an issue..."</p>
                <p>After a minute, the brunette opens the door and walks in, rubbing his eyes tiredly. "Sam, it's 8 in the mornin-- Holy shit!" He looks at Sam, his eyes going wide. "You look adorable!" He runs over and reaches up to feel one of Sam's wings, running his fingers through the feathers. Of course he's curious what they feel like. He's like a little kid, he has to touch anything that looks interesting. And those wings are heavenly soft, like touching a fluffy cloud.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam twitches and quickly puts a hand over his mouth, not wanting Jacob to see the smile creeping onto his face. With his free hand, he pushes Jacob back softly. "How do I get rid of them?"</p>
                <p>"How would I know, you're the doctor. And they are so soft~! Why do you want to get rid of them?" The shorter male giggles and bats Sam's hand away, still wanting to feel the wings. They're just so soft.</p>
                <p>"J-Jacob, stop touching!" He fights to maintain his composure, keeping that hand over his mouth, so his words are muffled. "Where did they come from?" He again tries to push the other away.</p>
                <p>This time when Sam tries to push him away, Jacob grins and does stop. "I don't know. Wanna sit down? You look like you could use a second to process things~" That is probably why Sam called for his assistance. So he could have someone to talk to and be comforted by.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The younger boy looks down at Jacob and nods. He was shaking a bit as he has a thousand questions swirling around his mind. Did God choose him for something? Or are they not actually angel wings, are they just wings? And again, where did they COME FROM?! Jacob is right. He needs to sit down and think about this. So, he goes to do just that, lowering his hand and going to his bed to sit down.</p>
                <p>Jacob happily jumps next to the younger boy on the bed. "Do they hurt? Do you know how to control them? I doubt there's anything you can do to get rid of them, so you should learn to live with them."</p>
                <p>"I could chop them off..."</p>
                <p>"That's not the right answer, and you know it~" He chuckles softly and tries to run his fingers through Sam's wings again, making the other let out a surprised giggle. "So far, I know two things about them~ They're very soft, and they seem to be very sensitive~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Jacob! S-stohop it! Thahahat's not helpful! No, JACOB!" He squeaks as the brunette pushes him down on the bed and pins him down. "Jacob, I don't even know how they got there nor do I know how to use them, don't you dare try to make this harder-"</p>
                <p>"Oh, Samikins~ C'mon, I know you're already overthinking this. Yes, it's weird, but is this any weirder than the fact I can time travel? No. Normal doesn't exist anymore. And I have to show you why these wings should stay~" He says playfully, lightly spidering his fingers over one of Sam's wings.</p>
                <p>That easily makes the blonde dissolve into a fit of giggles, struggling to push Jacob off himself. His wings flutter a little to the touch. "Nohoho! Dohohon't!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob just loves watching the other struggle and giggle cutely, digging his fingers into his wings. "And why not~?" He knows Sam can't answer. The blonde breaks down into laughter when Jacob starts to go harder, and he can't speak through his silent laughter, which annoys him to no end. "Can my wittle Samikins not handle some wittle tickles~?"</p>
                <p>Sam kicks his legs around as he fights to push Jacob off him. When that doesn't work, he ends up just hugging himself and trying to curls up into a ball as he laughs helplessly. His wings are fluttering and twitching like crazy, he has no control over them. And Jacob's teasing doesn't help, seeming to make him even more wild and make him blush.</p>
                <p>"You're so adorable~" Jacob giggles and decides to slow to a stop. Sam is probably still freaked out, he just couldn't help himself. He loves seeing that smile on the blondes face, and he wanted to be able to bury his hands in those soft feathers. That was the perfect excuse to do both. "I think you should keep the wings~ I know I probably just gave you another reason to hate them, but think about it this way: you have the best way of comforting someone. Who wouldn't want to be hugged and wrapped up in something so soft?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The blonde slowly starts to get himself back together, his wings still twitching as he's still a giggly, blushing mess. "Hehehehe~... Thahahat wahahas... Ahaha... Unnehehecessahahary..." He takes a deep breath to help calm himself down and regain his composure. "Don't ever do that again-"</p>
                <p>The brunette just grins, shaking his head. "I make no promises~ Now c'mon, let's go make breakfast. I think you need to just live with those wings for a few days before you make any plans to do anything drastic. Alright?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"I don't think I'm getting through that door..."</p>
                <p>"Why?... OH!" Jacob laughs softly. "You really can't retract them?" When Sam shakes his head, the brunette can't help laughing again. "Guess I'm going to have to be taking care of you until you can learn~"</p>
            </div>

            <summary><h1>Battleship</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>"B9." The blonde calls out, a subtle grin on his face. He has this game in the bag. He has most of Jacob's ships already sunken and c9 was a hit. It's only a matter of time before he wins.</p>
                <p>The two were in the living room playing some battleship. Each of them were on their own couch, a coffee table in between them with the board in the middle. Both of them had some paper out to take notes on what spots were already hit and whatnot.</p>
                <p>"Hit..." the brunette stares at his side of the board. Sam has that smug grin on his face, he has something up his sleeve, that's for sure. But there's only one direction he can go if he wants to finish this ship off. E3 was a hit, f3 and e2 were misses, and on e5 is another ship that he already sunk. So, it has to be... "D3?"</p>
                <p>Now the grin widens. "Miss~" Oh, he's enjoying this. Now comes the moment of realization for the other, the moment Sam has been waiting for since the beginning of the game.</p>
                <p>"What? But... You have another ship on E5, you can't have two ships touching-" Jacob looks up at Sam, confused. And just by seeing the angel's face, he gets annoyed. "Oh, shut up, don't act all high and mighty. You cheated!"</p>
                <p>"Not-uh, check the rules!" Sam takes the rule pamphlet out of the box and opens it up to a picture of a sample board set up with two ship touching each other, not separated by one or more spaces. It's in the rulebook, so it's fair game.</p>
                <p>With a glare, Jacob snatches the pamphlet away from Sam and closes it. He doesn't want to see the proof Sam is right. "You cheated... But fine. Go, it's your turn."</p>
                <p>"A9~"</p>
                <p>"Hit, and you sunk the ship. E4?" Sam must have it set up so he has a 2 piece vertical boat right next to a 5 piece horizontal boat. He already sunk the 5-piecer. Thats the only way this works.</p>
                <p>"Hit, but you didn't sink the ship~" That grin widens. God, Jacob wants to kill this man.</p>
                <p>"Excuse me? But... There's nowhere else for the boat to be! What do you mean not sunken?! What, do you have a boat defying the laws of physics and phasing through another boat?! Sam, at least cheat in a reasonable way!"</p>
                <p>"No... You're boxing your thought process in. See, you think its a small vertical boat being stopped by a long horizontal boat... But when you got the horizontal one, you accidentally hit the vertical one BEFORE finishing off the horizontal one. That made you think it was all one ship. It's actually two~"</p>
                <p>Jacob doesn't understand what Sam's saying. But that doesn't matter. He's pissed off. Sam's being a dick, and he knows it. He's playing dirty. He can't let that slide. "... Alright, you asked for it." Suddenly, he hops down from his couch before tackling Sam down on the other couch, grabbing at his hands to make sure he doesn't try anything.</p>
                <p>This immediately makes Sam break into a fit of nervous, adorable giggles as he tries to squirm away from Jacob's grasp. "H-Hey now, thehehere's no need to dohoho anything drahahastic, we can tahahalk about this-"</p>
                <p>"I don't want to talk about it. You've been a bad boy~ It's only fair you get taught a lesson." He holds onto the blonde's wrists with one of his hands, gently trailing his other hand down one of Sam's wings. They really are the softest things he has ever felt. And he knows how sensitive they are, which makes it all the more enjoyable to touch them. Since merely trailing a hand down one of them makes Sam giggle like crazy and squirm around more, his wing twitching at the feeling.</p>
                <p>"Jahahacohob! Wahahait!"</p>
                <p>Jacob steals one of the feathers from Sam's wings, careful not to hurt him at all in the process. Then he holds it in front of himself, where Sam can very clearly see it, threatening the angel. He also let's go of Sam's wrists. He's trying to get him to direct his focus away from his now free hand. "Yes~? What should I wait for~?"</p>
                <p>Sam quickly tries to grab the feather from Jacob. But the minute he tries, Jacob suddenly let's go of it and digs his hands into his sides, scribbling his fingers up and down rapidly. The blonde squeals and dissolves into a fit of laughter, no longer able to speak. His laugh is really quiet, almost silent. It makes it hard to speak through. Jacob knows that Sam doesn't actually mind light stuff, since he can still talk through that. Not being able to talk drives him mad, and he hates that.</p>
                <p>"You should've thought before you cheated~ And don't say you didn't cheat and that its technically in the rules, I don't care! You know that I wasn't aware of those rules. Which makes it an unfair advantage, aka, cheating~" Jacob can't let Sam get away with this unpunished. The blonde must've known it wouldn't end well for him, he sealed his own fate, just to piss off Jacob. Which just means he can't go easy on the guy, since the guy probably already mentally prepared himself for that. His hands trail down to Sam's hips before squeezing them a few times. This really makes Sam go wild, kicking his legs around as he bucks his hips, struggling to get away. Luckily for Sam, he doesn't keep this up for too long. He knows Sam can only take so much. So eventually, he stops, a huge grin on his face now too.</p>
                <p>Sam takes some time to get himself back together, still a giggly mess as he slowly catches his breath. "Ihihi... Ihihi wahahasn't cheheheating~ It wahahas ihi--" Jacob gives his hips another squeeze. "EEK! NOhoho! Sohohorry!"</p>
                <p>Jacob rolls his eyes and gets off Sam, leaving him be now. "You asshole~"</p>
                <p>"Lahahanguage!" Sam sits up and starts trying to fix his appearance, readjusting his clothes and attempting to make his hair stop sticking up. After thrashing around so much, his hair has become a mess. "And why do you think you can call me the cheater? I was playing smart, not illegally. Whereas you, whenever we play Mario Kart and I'm inevitably winning, you..." His sentence trails off, he gets flustered just by the word.</p>
                <p>"Oh? What do I do~? Please, tell me Samikins, how do I cheat at Mario Kart~?"</p>
                <p>Sam blushes a little and looks down to hide it. "S-Shut up..."</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly, moving over to be closer to Sam, gently pulling at Sam's wing to get him to wrap it around him. Which, Sam obliges, wrapping a wing around Jacob and letting him cuddle. "I'm sorry, you just look so cute like that~"</p>
                <p>"I am not cute!"</p>
                <p>Jacob rolls his eyes. "Yes you are~" He looks down at the coffee table to see how Sam actually had his battleships board set up. There wasn't even only one instance of boats being less than a block away from each other, there were multiple. Jacob never stood a chance. At least not in the game. "... You are an asshole-"</p>
                <p>This time, Sam doesn't tell Jacob off for swearing. Mainly due to Jacob's tone of bewilderment and slight admiration. That smug grin tugs at Sam's lips again. "I know~"</p>

                <p>It's been one year since Jacob has gotten Jay to speak his first words towards him. That's great and all, it took him three years to be able to do it, but that's still pretty sad... Only talking... His tone is mostly monotone as well. He might as well be a robot.</p>
                <p>Though Jacob can't really blame him... The guy has gone through a lot...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>----</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob wakes up to a pebble bouncing off his head, groaning softly and rolling over. "It's still dark outside..." He whines, covering his head with his arms to block out the morning rays of sunlight.</p>
                <p>"We have to keep going, they're closing in on us-" Jays deep but quiet voice penetrates through the silence of the forest. Well, almost silence. Birds and small animals can still be heard.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>They had just escaped from the lab. That's why Jay says they should keep moving, because he know that Jacob won't be able to survive much longer in that dang cell.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"I don't want t- Alright, alright, I'm going!" Jacob cuts himself off halfway as Jay started trying to drag him up to his feet. He looks up at the taller male tiredly, letting out a sigh. "Did you get any sleep? You really don't look good..."</p>
                <p>Jay dismissively waves Jacobs concerns off, pulling him to get him to start walking. "I'm fine, we need to get moving!" His expression and his voice both are void of any feelings, but his eyes... His electric blue eyes are filled with fear and paranoia as he tries to hurry Jacob along, staying alert to any disturbances around them.</p>
                <p>This makes Jacob's heart sink. This innocent boy is constantly tormented by his past, and there's not much the brunet can do about it. "Jay... When's the last time you were happy?" That stops the curly haired blonde in his tracks. "I just... You're always so stressed out and stuff. I mean, these circumstances aren't the best, we could die at any minute, but... You still deserve to be happy..."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"...Happy? What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
                <p>Oh, his heart just plummeted down another foot-</p>
                <p>"You don't know what happiness is?"</p>
                <p>"..." The tall boy shakes his head. But then he focuses himself again. "It doesn't matter, we need to keep moving," he mutters as he grabs the midgets arm and pulls him through the trees and branches.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob shakes his head as well now, standing his ground and keeping Jay from continuing onward. "No, it does matter, Jay. It matters a lot." He walks up to Jay, softly wrapping his arms around his waist in a hug.</p>
                <p>Jay really wants to get out of this forest. He wants to get to safety. He doesn't have time for this. So, he puts his arms around Jacob and lifts him up bridal style, holding him close as he continues on walking like that.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Have you ever laughed? Smiled? Anything?" Jacob asks as he gives up and just curls up in Jay's arms, enjoying his warmth. But he does get an idea, softly slipping a hand under his shirt but making it seem like he was just trying to hug him more.</p>
                <p>The scared boy shrugs his shoulders. "Once. But then the scientists cut my finger off for it." He shivers a little at the feeling of Jacobs cold hand, but he loves any type of affection, so he doesn't mind.</p>
                <p>"But both of your hands have all fingers-" He starts to ever so lightly skitter his hand along Jay's bare side.</p>
                <p>"I was o-only five when it h-happened, it grew ba-ack... What a-are you doing?" Jay asks as he tries to keep walking, his breath catching in his throat a few times.</p>
                <p>A smirk rises to Jacob's lips as he goes a little harder, moving his hand up towards his ribs. "I'm trying to make you happy~"</p>
                <p>His lips twitch, but he fights to keep a straight face. "C-cut it o-out! We have to k-keep going. S-Stop horsing aro-ound!"</p>
                <p>Jacob adds his other hand in, reaching up and starting to scribble his fingers along his underarms. "Oh, come on~ We've been walking for days, you need a break~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>A smile plays on Jays lip that he tries to fight back, but he can't help the giggles that start pouring out of him, his grip on Jacob starting to loosen a bit as he leans against a tree to support himself. His giggles have a weird sound to them. They sound like an anime schoolgirl giggle. "Stahap!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>This just encourages Jacob to keep going, speeding up a bit as well. "Aw, but that's such an adorable laugh~! And you need some laughter in your life~"</p>
                <p>Jay ends up falling to the ground, which makes it easier for Jacob to pin him down and start to really tickle him, which gets him squealing and laughing, kicking his legs a bit. "JaHaHACohOb!" His laughter is even higher pitched than his giggles. He kinda sounds like a dying dolphin-</p>
                <p>Jacob grins and keeps this up for a while, exploring all over to find sweet spots and make Jay laugh louder. It's... Freeing.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p><i>(This paragraph is from Jay's perspective, he sees life through metaphors-)</i></p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>All his life, it's been as if he were trapped in a dark room, blind, unable to know what was safe, but it's like... This bright light... This big ball of light in the sky has come pouring through the window, blocked only by the curtains. He's scared of the new change, so he keeps the curtains closed, blocking out the light as much as he can.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>But then once Jacob stops, Jay rolls over and pins the shorter boy down, attacking his ribs.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He opens the curtains. It's such a freeing feeling, like this weight has finally been lifted off of him, like he could fly if he wanted. Jacob has opened Jays eyes up to the true beauty of the world outside that window, the world he can finally see. Jacob is the sun and Jay is all the plants growing towards him, reaching for his light.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He can finally see.</p>
                <p>He can finally be free.</p>
                <p>He can finally thrive and feel things he's never felt before.</p>
                <p>He can be happy.</p>
                <p>He knows what it means to be happy.</p>
                <p>It might seem like an exaggeration, but it's not. He's never felt so... So... So light. So free. So happy.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>It was the first time he's ever laughed. And Jay is sure Jacob won't let it be the last.</p>
