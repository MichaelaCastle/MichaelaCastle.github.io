            <div class="content">
                <p>"No, try again. You're really close! 8 divided by 4 isn't 4, so how about we try thinking about it again?" Sam was sat next to Jacob on a nice couch, helping him with some math homework. The blonde always makes sure to try to help the other not get too frustrated with the work. That is a big part of tutoring, understanding that the people you're helping can get very frustrated. It's not the tutors fault, don't take it personally. When someone can't grasp a concept, thats frustrating. So, Sam always tries his best to make sure the brunette doesn't get too mad at himself.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob just groans and leans against Sam, whining quietly. "I don't want to... Can't we just play Mario Kart or something?"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head. "No, you're not going to convince or bribe me again. You're the one paying for this session! Don't throw your money away like that."</p>
                <p>The brunette rolls his eyes. "Yeah, says the rich kid... Couldn't you just give me sessions for free? Then we won't have that problem. You're not doing this for the money."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>That makes the blonde go quiet for a few moment, which makes Jacob's heart sink as he wonders if he said something wrong. "If... If you don't have the incentive of staying to get your money's full worth, you'll leave..."</p>
                <p>His heart sinks further down. "Sammy..." He sighs softly and pulls the younger male into a gentle hug. "You're too adorable to leave~" He ruffles his hair playfully, making him giggle and little and try to bat Jacob's hands away.</p>
                <p>"I'm not adorable!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"You can't say that after giggling like that~" He ruffles his hair again, just to see him act cute again.</p>
                <p>Sam giggles and this time just squirms out of Jacob's hug, picking up his pencil again. "Stop that, my hair is a mess to begin with!" He has a point. His hair is always just a ball of fluff on top of his head. But that's why Jacob likes messing with him like that. "You're trying to distract me again. It's not going to work. Now, what is 8 divided by 4?" He crosses his arms, trying his darndest to act professional. It just looks cute for an eight year old though.</p>
                <p>The older male smiles and reaches out to try to pry the younger males arms apart, accidentally brushing his hand against his side. Sam giggles a little again and pushes Jacob away. "I said it's not going to work!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Why did Sam giggle that time? With the hair ruffling, Jacob normally assumed it was just because Sam perceived it as a playful form of affection and that it was more of an embarrassed / nervous little giggle. But that one... That's not the same. Jacob tilts his head to the side as he thinks, squinting his vivid blue eyes at Sam. Until suddenly, his eyes open wide with realization as the scene replays in his mind. "Are you ticklish?!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam's bright green eyes widen too as the tips of his ears turn a slight shade of pink. He quickly shakes his head. "No-... W-we need to get back to work..."</p>
                <p>Nothing is going to be able to make Jacob think about anything else now however. A grin slowly pulls at his lips as he stares at the ever nervous boy in front of him. "I think you are~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The smaller boy looks up at Jacob, starting to giggle softly again from the simple accusation. "Noho I'm nohOT!" He quickly tosses his pencil down onto the table and jumps up to his feet to back away as Jacob makes an attempt to lunge at him. "Stay back!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The grin on Jacob's face just widens as he starts to giggle as well. "You better run, nerd! I don't like liars~!"</p>
                <p>Sam's face tinges a slight shade of pink, matching his ears now as giggles continue to slip past his lips. He doesn't need to hear that threat more than once, he makes a run for it. And Jacob is quick to get up and chase after him. The younger boy does not last that long before the other manages to jump and tackle him down to the ground, though he is careful not to hurt the blonde at all. "Gotcha!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Even before Jacob does anything to him, this adorable and carefree laughter pours out of Sam as he tries to squirm away from the older boy. "Nohohoho! Dohohohohon't!"</p>
                <p>It is impossible not to laugh along with Sam to an extent. His laughter is just so bubbly and adorable, its music to Jacob's ears. "Yohohou must be really ticklish, I'm not even touching you~" He teases playfully as he slowly pushes Sam's t-shirt up, which of course makes the blonde laugh and giggle more, fighting to try and block Jacob. "You're not getting out of this I'm afraid. You have made me really curious~ I’m gonna need to find all of your giggle spots. Unless you wanna help me so it can go by faster. Or do you WANT me to go slowly?”</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam just giggles and shakes his head to the best of his ability. Jacob was barely doing anything and Sam was already in pieces. This is going to be so much fun.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>“No? Okay then, guess I’ll have to find all of them myself. I’m gonna have to tickle here, and squeeze there, oh, and I have to claw this little area.”</p>
                <p>With every word, Jacob did that motion with a random spot on Sam's torso. First it was his ribs, then his sides, then his tummy. Every touch produces the cutest reactions from Sam. The younger male kicks his legs gently and balls his hands up into lil' fists as he laughs and rolls around, unable to get away from Jacob's ticklish grasp. "Stohahahahap! Nohoho, nohohot thehehehere! Ehehehe~! Jahahahacohohohob! Thihihihis ihihihsn't produhuhuhuctiHIHIHIVE!" He lets out an adorable squeal before quickly clamping his hands over his mouth to muffle the sound. Jacob had gotten to his hips.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"I thought you weren't ticklish, little man, why should I stop~? I think this is very productive. I get to teach you not to lie, and, I get to find a giggle spot like this~!" After seeing Sam's reaction, Jacob starts to squeeze his hips a few times and dig his thumbs into them gently.</p>
                <p>This drives the blonde crazy. He laughs loudly and flails about wildly. Jacob wouldn't be surprised if any neighbors got concerned when hearing Sam scream and laugh like this. "NOHO, JAHAHAKE, IHI--" He doesn't even finish his sentence, he just laughs more, squeezing his eyes tight, as if not being able to see the tickles will make it any better. But that means he doesn't see Jacob suddenly switch spots, he just feels the other gently skitter one of his hands over his neck, making him let out another squeal before dissolving into more laughter as he tries to scrunch his shoulders up.</p>
                <p>"You are so sensitive! How did I never realize before? I could've made you play with me without using cupcakes as a bribe this whole time!" Jacob giggles and stops targeting those spots, not wanting to be too mean to Sam. But he is having so much fun making him laugh like this, he's loving every second of this.</p>
                <p>Sam's laughter starts to die back down to a mixture of laughter and giggles, his face a bit red from laughing like that before. "Dohoho nohohot uhuhuse thihihis aghahainst mehehehe-!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>And just then, the front door opens. Jacob pauses for a moment and looks up, watching as Sam's father walks in. His father is a nice looking fellow, but the guy definitely seems confused by seeing Jacob pinning the giggly mess known as Sam down on the floor.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"... He's teaching me how to add. See, 3 plus 2 is one, two, three... four, five~!" Jacob comes up with an excuse, counting to three with Sam's left ribs, and adding the other two with the right. The blonde squeaks and giggles more, now blushing like crazy since his father is witnessing this. But thats definitely a better explanation than anything Sam would be able to come up with in this state.</p>
                <p>His father smiles a little. Jacob is obviously lying, but its not everyday that he sees Sam that happy around someone his age. "I think you'd be able to get to higher numbers if you used his fingers or toes~" Is all he says before leaving the two kids alone, making his way to his office.</p>
                <p>Jacob looks down at Sam with a grin.</p>
                <p>Sam quickly shakes his head. "H-hehey now, Ihihi'm proud you actually gohohot the rihihight answer there, but dohohon't you dahahahare-"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Sorry, but that was a suggestion from your father, I'm not going to ignore that~!" The brunette says playfully before turning around and gently taking Sam's socks off. Sam is quick to try to pull his legs away and curl his toes defensively, but he can't get away from Jacob. "Now, how ticklish are these? How about this? Oh, and these definitely deserve a good scratching~" He starts to explore Sam's feet, testing out to see where's most ticklish. To begin with, he targets Sam's soles, arches, and heels.</p>
                <p>That's enough to get the blonde to descend into bubbly giggles again, wiggling his feet around to try to avoid Jacob's hands. And Jacob does have fun with just that. But eventually, he does have to at least try it...</p>
                <p>He gently holds Sam's toes back with one hand, using the other to scribble his fingers along the stems.</p>
                <p>"JAHAHAHACOB! NAHAHAHA! Ehehehehe!" Sam tosses his head back as he starts laughing again, hugging himself as he laughs. "Cuhuhuhut ihihit ohohout~!"</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly and does stop. He's had his fun. He gets off Sam and offers him a hand to help him up. "You are so adorable~ I love hearing you laugh."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam takes some time to get himself back together, still giddy and smiling like a madman. "Yohohou're a mean poopyhead~" He takes Jacob's hand... And pulls him back down, suddenly pouncing on him.</p>
                <p>Jacob is taken aback, but he just smiles and lets the smaller boy have this moment. "I'm sorry, but unlike you, I find this fun~"</p>
                <p>"So do I. Just not when you're mean." So Sam was actually fine with that whole thing, he found it fun. Even though he fought back so much.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob can't help the giant smile on his face as he reaches up and hugs Sam close to his chest, slipping his hands under his shirt and spidering them up and down his sides, trapping the blonde in a tickly hug.</p>
                <p>Sam, even though he had managed to get on top of Jacob, ends up not having the upper hand as he collapses into a fit of giggles again. "Nohoho! Jahahacob!" He curls up in Jacob's arms, squirming around and kicking his legs softly. "Thihihis stihihihill ihihihsn't produhuhuhuctihihive!"</p>
                <p>"We got enough math done, I'm perfectly fine spending the rest of our hour having fun~ We only have a few minutes left anyway~"</p>

        <details id="SubjectOfSentence">
            <summary><h1>The Subject of The Sentence</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Jacob stares at the sentences in front of him. 'The dog ran after the ball.' What is the object of the sentence...</p>
                <p>Sam was patiently giving Jacob some time to think, swinging his legs back and forth over the edge of the couch. "What is the action word being applied to?" He asks, giving the brunette a hint.</p>
                <p>He thinks for another few moments. Action word... ran? Who's doing the running... "The dog?"</p>
                <p>"Yes!" Sam smiles brightly as Jacob gets the answer right. "The dog is doing the running."</p>
                <p>"Just like I'm always the one doing the tickling~" Jacob says that purely just to get a reaction out of Sam.</p>
                <p>And it works, the tips of Sam's ears turn a bit pink. "I never should have used that example..."</p>
                <p>"But it helps! Seriously!" Jacob says with a small laugh. As crazy as that sounds, its the truth. "I don't know why, but it really does help me."</p>
                <p>The blonde rolls his eyes. "That's because its something you enjoy and something you can relate to. And thats why I used it as an example. I just didn't think about the consequences of that example... I was just trying to quickly come up with something you liked, and--" He was starting to speak a little too fast for Jacob to be able to understand him. The rest of what he was trying to say just sounds like a string of unrelated sounds. Sometimes it really seems like this kids brain is working faster than his body can handle, he can't get the words out fast enough to keep up with his own mind.</p>
                <p>Jacob just waits for the younger, hyperactive boy to finish his unintelligible sentence, smiling. He always finds it cute when Sam gets a little too into talking about or explaining a topic. "Hey Sam, I know I brought it up a few weeks ago, but I was thinking... Can I stop paying for these sessions?"</p>
                <p>Sam looks like Jacob just stabbed him in the heart.</p>
                <p>"I just want to be your friend. And I know you're not doing this for the money, you are spoiled rich~ You just wanted someone to talk to. I like you, I really like you. And, I don't want to stop having the ability to hang out with you just because I can't afford tutoring anymore."</p>
                <p>"... Are you struggling financially?"</p>
                <p>"A little..." The brunette sheepishly puts his pencil down on the table. "And tutoring is one of the non-essential costs." He really can't tell if Sam even picked up on the 'I like you, I really like you' part. That part was an attempt at a confession, it seems to have failed.</p>
                <p>"... I guess this can be for free." Sam goes back to smiling now, no longer hurt by the possibility of Jacob leaving. "But don't take that to mean you can just fool around the whole time. I still want you to increase your grades."</p>
                <p>"I mess with you the whole time regardless~" Jacob loves getting reactions out of Sam. Everything about him is just so adorable. His laugh, his smile, the way he gets overly excited about certain science topics, the way he tries and totally fails to look tough when he's pouting, the fact that he's so dang innocent and naive... Jacob takes every opportunity he can to see Sam break that 'professional' composure. "Speaking of which, can we play Mario Kart? I don't want to work anymore right now~"</p>
                <p>Sam sighs softly and shakes his head. "No, I'm not going to be persuaded again. You need to work on--- Ee! Jahahacohohob!"</p>
                <p>The brunette had pulled Sam into a hug quickly to trap him as he starts to spider his fingers up Sam's sides. The blonde squeaks and dissolves into a fit of giggles, kicking his legs softly as he tries and fails to get away from Jacob's hold. "What was that~? I think I heard an 'oh, that's a great idea'~? Is that right?"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head. "Nohoho!" He attempts to stand his ground, but it doesn't last very long. As soon as Jacob trails a hand down to squeeze his hips, he breaks. "NOHO! Okahahahay, okahay, yohohou wihihihin!"</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly and lets Sam go, happy with that answer. "Thats what I thought~" Ever since he found out how ticklish Sam is, he's been using it against the kid all the time. And it works every time.</p>

            <summary><h1>What if I can't make you happy?</h1><h2 class="twc">Trigger warning: Depression/Suicide</h2></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It was 4:30 in the afternoon. Jacob was at the hospital, visiting his best friend, Sam. He's been beside Sam's bedside day in and day out after school for the last week. The doctors say Sam will be able to be released in a few days, they just need to keep him under watch a little longer to make sure the new medicine is working. It's been almost a year since Jacob last saw a real smile on Sam's face, it's always fake.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He watched Sam's life spiral out of control and did nothing about it... What idiot wou—</p>
                <p>No. He's here now, and that's what matters. Sam's not dead, it's not too late to turn things around.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Hey," Jacob says quietly as he takes a seat in the chair beside the white bed.</p>
                <p>Of course, the green-eyed blonde on the bed is busy trying to catch up on schoolwork he missed. "Greetings and salutation." His voice is soft and warm, while Jacob's has more energy and emotion. "Would have never guessed that you would come."</p>
                <p>Jacob chuckles softly at that, shaking his head, his caramel brown hair falling in his face. "I miss you! I have no one bribe with cupcakes to go play Mario Kart with me anymore!"</p>
                <p>Giving Jacob a weak smile, Sam shrugs, scribbling down numbers on his math homework which lay scattered about on the bed. He's also sitting in an odd position — he's sitting on one leg while the other one is up, his arm resting on it. It's like a half-kneel, half-hugging-knees-to-chest pose. "I'm sure you could find someone..."</p>
                <p>"Not-uh! I don't have to bride anyone else with cupcakes to play with me! It's not the same..." He sticks his bottom lip out, pouting.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He misses those days... What ever happened to them? The days when he'd text Sam to come over and play something, and when he refused, Jacob would go whip up a batch of cupcakes, and just like that, Sam would change his mind. The days when they would joke around and laugh for hours. The days when Jacob would randomly mention something that happens to spark Sam's interest and end up having to wait ten minutes while Sam goes on some nerd tangent about H. H. Holmes and Daniel Hudson Burnham and the Ferris wheel!</p>
                <p>Why didn't he DO anything when those times stopped happening... Why didn't he make the connection...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Sam...?" The midget looks at Sam with sad blue eyes.</p>
                <p>"Yeah?"</p>
                <p>"Was there anything I could have done? If I had stood up for you, tried to help, walked with you to school, spent more time with you... Would you still have jumped? I'm sorry, I just... I can't stop thinking about it..."</p>
                <p>Sam puts his pencil down, collecting his papers into a stack and putting them into a folder, which he then sets to the side, turning to face Jacob. "You did nothing wrong, Jacob. You don't need to worry about me, I'm fine now. Asking yourself what if's is only going to make you feel terrible. I don't know what would have happened if things were different, I... I don't know... I don't know anything..."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob gets up and runs on over to Sam, almost knocking him over as he hugs him tightly. "I'm... I'm scared, Sam..."</p>
                <p>"I know, but we're going to get through this, alright?" Sam put his leg down so its easier for him to hug Jacob as well, softly rubbing his back. "Together." He gives Jacob a reassuring smile, which only makes his stomach turn sharply.</p>
                <p>"When was the last time you were genuinely happy? What if I can't cheer you up? Sam, I don't want to lose you again, but I... I don't know how to stop you!"</p>
                <p>"You're not going to lose me. I saw her up there... Lindsey. I'm not going to try to do anything stupid again, I promise. I can't support Simon if I'm not here."</p>
                <p>"But what's the point of living if you're not happy?! I couldn't make you happy before, why would I be able to now?" The older male buries his head against the blonde, fighting back tears.</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head, holding him close. "Sure you can~! You could before, what are you talking about? That's your specialty~ Annoying people and magically putting a smile on their face."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob lets out a surprised laugh, now softly pushing Sam and shaking his head. "Wow, thanks! Putting annoying before the positive trait, because clearly, that's more prominent~!"</p>
                <p>"Exactly~ Glad your simple mind could process that~" This was the most outgoing thing Sam has said in a long time. The last time he said anything like that, he— Wait a minute...</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Suddenly, the midget pounces on the nerd, pushing his shirt up and scribbling his fingers along Sam's exposed stomach. And then, something wonderful happens. Something magical. Oh, Jacob's heart is going to explode he's so happy! Sam falls into a fit of giggles, and my god, Jacob can feel his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
                <p>Sam tried to hold back his laughter, but Jacob took him by surprise, he had no time to prepare. "JAHACOHOB! Thihis ihisn't whahahat Ihi meheheheant!" He tosses his head back, trying to push the little guy off him, but he's not the strongest person out there. He's a nerd. Nerds aren't known for being strong or fast.</p>
                <p>"You sure about that, Sammy~? Guess that's just what my simple mind could process~" Jacob could not be smiling any wider than he already is, cherishing the smile on Sam's face. But something's different about it this time. His laughter used to be more infectious and recognizable... Now... Now his laughter is almost silent. It's kind of cute, making Jacobs' heart flutter. Sam's laughter goes completely silent when Jacob starts to dig his fingers into Sam's ribs, making him kick his legs around and squirm around helplessly.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Twenty, maybe thirty minutes go by before Jacob finally stops, blowing one last raspberry onto Sams' stomach to get one last adorable squeal out of him. After that, he just lets him catch his breath and calm down, lying down on the bed next to him, grinning like an idiot, letting out a satisfied sigh. "We gotta do that more often!"</p>
                <p>Sam shakes his head, curling up into a ball, a giggly mess beside Jacob. He may try to deny it, but as much as he hates to admit it, that was pretty fun... More fun than he's had in a while...</p>
                <p>And every day from then on, until Sam got released from the hospital, the first thing Jacob would do when he went to see Sam was tickling the heck out of him, leaving him in a giddy mood for the rest of the day. Sam almost misses being in the hospital — Almost. It still sucked in there when Jacob wasn't around.</p>

        <details id="Wings">
            <summary><h1>Wings</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This is wrong. Where did they come from? Is he crazy? He must be hallucinating.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>A huge pair of wings are spread out behind Sam as he stares in the mirror. Wings that look to be almost 11 feet long each. Angel wings. But he's not an angel, this can't be right.</p>
                <p>He neglects his little brother, he can't keep a non-shady job, everyone hates him, he's a failure, he's not an angel! So where did these wings come from? Even if God decided he was worthy, WHERE DID THE WINGS COME FROM? How did they just appear overnight? This can't be a mutation, people only get one mutation, and he already has one. So how did this happen?</p>
                <p>How is he going to hide them? He looks ridiculous with these things. What is he, an angelic businessman? That sounds like something straight out of a cartoon.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Jacob?" The blonde calls out, leaning over his dresser as he stares in the mirror. "I... I have an issue..."</p>
                <p>After a minute, the brunette opens the door and walks in, rubbing his eyes tiredly. "Sam, it's 8 in the mornin-- Holy shit!" He looks at Sam, his eyes going wide. "You look adorable!" He runs over and reaches up to feel one of Sam's wings, running his fingers through the feathers. Of course he's curious what they feel like. He's like a little kid, he has to touch anything that looks interesting. And those wings are heavenly soft, like touching a fluffy cloud.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Sam twitches and quickly puts a hand over his mouth, not wanting Jacob to see the smile creeping onto his face. With his free hand, he pushes Jacob back softly. "How do I get rid of them?"</p>
                <p>"How would I know, you're the doctor. And they are so soft~! Why do you want to get rid of them?" The shorter male giggles and bats Sam's hand away, still wanting to feel the wings. They're just so soft.</p>
                <p>"J-Jacob, stop touching!" He fights to maintain his composure, keeping that hand over his mouth, so his words are muffled. "Where did they come from?" He again tries to push the other away.</p>
                <p>This time when Sam tries to push him away, Jacob grins and does stop. "I don't know. Wanna sit down? You look like you could use a second to process things~" That is probably why Sam called for his assistance. So he could have someone to talk to and be comforted by.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The younger boy looks down at Jacob and nods. He was shaking a bit as he has a thousand questions swirling around his mind. Did God choose him for something? Or are they not actually angel wings, are they just wings? And again, where did they COME FROM?! Jacob is right. He needs to sit down and think about this. So, he goes to do just that, lowering his hand and going to his bed to sit down.</p>
                <p>Jacob happily jumps next to the younger boy on the bed. "Do they hurt? Do you know how to control them? I doubt there's anything you can do to get rid of them, so you should learn to live with them."</p>
                <p>"I could chop them off..."</p>
                <p>"That's not the right answer, and you know it~" He chuckles softly and tries to run his fingers through Sam's wings again, making the other let out a surprised giggle. "So far, I know two things about them~ They're very soft, and they seem to be very sensitive~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Jacob! S-stohop it! Thahahat's not helpful! No, JACOB!" He squeaks as the brunette pushes him down on the bed and pins him down. "Jacob, I don't even know how they got there nor do I know how to use them, don't you dare try to make this harder-"</p>
                <p>"Oh, Samikins~ C'mon, I know you're already overthinking this. Yes, it's weird, but is this any weirder than the fact I can time travel? No. Normal doesn't exist anymore. And I have to show you why these wings should stay~" He says playfully, lightly spidering his fingers over one of Sam's wings.</p>
                <p>That easily makes the blonde dissolve into a fit of giggles, struggling to push Jacob off himself. His wings flutter a little to the touch. "Nohoho! Dohohon't!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob just loves watching the other struggle and giggle cutely, digging his fingers into his wings. "And why not~?" He knows Sam can't answer. The blonde breaks down into laughter when Jacob starts to go harder, and he can't speak through his silent laughter, which annoys him to no end. "Can my wittle Samikins not handle some wittle tickles~?"</p>
                <p>Sam kicks his legs around as he fights to push Jacob off him. When that doesn't work, he ends up just hugging himself and trying to curls up into a ball as he laughs helplessly. His wings are fluttering and twitching like crazy, he has no control over them. And Jacob's teasing doesn't help, seeming to make him even more wild and make him blush.</p>
                <p>"You're so adorable~" Jacob giggles and decides to slow to a stop. Sam is probably still freaked out, he just couldn't help himself. He loves seeing that smile on the blondes face, and he wanted to be able to bury his hands in those soft feathers. That was the perfect excuse to do both. "I think you should keep the wings~ I know I probably just gave you another reason to hate them, but think about it this way: you have the best way of comforting someone. Who wouldn't want to be hugged and wrapped up in something so soft?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>The blonde slowly starts to get himself back together, his wings still twitching as he's still a giggly, blushing mess. "Hehehehe~... Thahahat wahahas... Ahaha... Unnehehecessahahary..." He takes a deep breath to help calm himself down and regain his composure. "Don't ever do that again-"</p>
                <p>The brunette just grins, shaking his head. "I make no promises~ Now c'mon, let's go make breakfast. I think you need to just live with those wings for a few days before you make any plans to do anything drastic. Alright?"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"I don't think I'm getting through that door..."</p>
                <p>"Why?... OH!" Jacob laughs softly. "You really can't retract them?" When Sam shakes his head, the brunette can't help laughing again. "Guess I'm going to have to be taking care of you until you can learn~"</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details id="Battleship">
            <summary><h1>Battleship</h1></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>"B9." The blonde calls out, a subtle grin on his face. He has this game in the bag. He has most of Jacob's ships already sunken and c9 was a hit. It's only a matter of time before he wins.</p>
                <p>The two were in the living room playing some battleship. Each of them were on their own couch, a coffee table in between them with the board in the middle. Both of them had some paper out to take notes on what spots were already hit and whatnot.</p>
                <p>"Hit..." the brunette stares at his side of the board. Sam has that smug grin on his face, he has something up his sleeve, that's for sure. But there's only one direction he can go if he wants to finish this ship off. E3 was a hit, f3 and e2 were misses, and on e5 is another ship that he already sunk. So, it has to be... "D3?"</p>
                <p>Now the grin widens. "Miss~" Oh, he's enjoying this. Now comes the moment of realization for the other, the moment Sam has been waiting for since the beginning of the game.</p>
                <p>"What? But... You have another ship on E5, you can't have two ships touching-" Jacob looks up at Sam, confused. And just by seeing the angel's face, he gets annoyed. "Oh, shut up, don't act all high and mighty. You cheated!"</p>
                <p>"Not-uh, check the rules!" Sam takes the rule pamphlet out of the box and opens it up to a picture of a sample board set up with two ship touching each other, not separated by one or more spaces. It's in the rulebook, so it's fair game.</p>
                <p>With a glare, Jacob snatches the pamphlet away from Sam and closes it. He doesn't want to see the proof Sam is right. "You cheated... But fine. Go, it's your turn."</p>
                <p>"A9~"</p>
                <p>"Hit, and you sunk the ship. E4?" Sam must have it set up so he has a 2 piece vertical boat right next to a 5 piece horizontal boat. He already sunk the 5-piecer. Thats the only way this works.</p>
                <p>"Hit, but you didn't sink the ship~" That grin widens. God, Jacob wants to kill this man.</p>
                <p>"Excuse me? But... There's nowhere else for the boat to be! What do you mean not sunken?! What, do you have a boat defying the laws of physics and phasing through another boat?! Sam, at least cheat in a reasonable way!"</p>
                <p>"No... You're boxing your thought process in. See, you think its a small vertical boat being stopped by a long horizontal boat... But when you got the horizontal one, you accidentally hit the vertical one BEFORE finishing off the horizontal one. That made you think it was all one ship. It's actually two~"</p>
                <p>Jacob doesn't understand what Sam's saying. But that doesn't matter. He's pissed off. Sam's being a dick, and he knows it. He's playing dirty. He can't let that slide. "... Alright, you asked for it." Suddenly, he hops down from his couch before tackling Sam down on the other couch, grabbing at his hands to make sure he doesn't try anything.</p>
                <p>This immediately makes Sam break into a fit of nervous, adorable giggles as he tries to squirm away from Jacob's grasp. "H-Hey now, thehehere's no need to dohoho anything drahahastic, we can tahahalk about this-"</p>
                <p>"I don't want to talk about it. You've been a bad boy~ It's only fair you get taught a lesson." He holds onto the blonde's wrists with one of his hands, gently trailing his other hand down one of Sam's wings. They really are the softest things he has ever felt. And he knows how sensitive they are, which makes it all the more enjoyable to touch them. Since merely trailing a hand down one of them makes Sam giggle like crazy and squirm around more, his wing twitching at the feeling.</p>
                <p>"Jahahacohob! Wahahait!"</p>
                <p>Jacob steals one of the feathers from Sam's wings, careful not to hurt him at all in the process. Then he holds it in front of himself, where Sam can very clearly see it, threatening the angel. He also let's go of Sam's wrists. He's trying to get him to direct his focus away from his now free hand. "Yes~? What should I wait for~?"</p>
                <p>Sam quickly tries to grab the feather from Jacob. But the minute he tries, Jacob suddenly let's go of it and digs his hands into his sides, scribbling his fingers up and down rapidly. The blonde squeals and dissolves into a fit of laughter, no longer able to speak. His laugh is really quiet, almost silent. It makes it hard to speak through. Jacob knows that Sam doesn't actually mind light stuff, since he can still talk through that. Not being able to talk drives him mad, and he hates that.</p>
                <p>"You should've thought before you cheated~ And don't say you didn't cheat and that its technically in the rules, I don't care! You know that I wasn't aware of those rules. Which makes it an unfair advantage, aka, cheating~" Jacob can't let Sam get away with this unpunished. The blonde must've known it wouldn't end well for him, he sealed his own fate, just to piss off Jacob. Which just means he can't go easy on the guy, since the guy probably already mentally prepared himself for that. His hands trail down to Sam's hips before squeezing them a few times. This really makes Sam go wild, kicking his legs around as he bucks his hips, struggling to get away. Luckily for Sam, he doesn't keep this up for too long. He knows Sam can only take so much. So eventually, he stops, a huge grin on his face now too.</p>
                <p>Sam takes some time to get himself back together, still a giggly mess as he slowly catches his breath. "Ihihi... Ihihi wahahasn't cheheheating~ It wahahas ihi--" Jacob gives his hips another squeeze. "EEK! NOhoho! Sohohorry!"</p>
                <p>Jacob rolls his eyes and gets off Sam, leaving him be now. "You asshole~"</p>
                <p>"Lahahanguage!" Sam sits up and starts trying to fix his appearance, readjusting his clothes and attempting to make his hair stop sticking up. After thrashing around so much, his hair has become a mess. "And why do you think you can call me the cheater? I was playing smart, not illegally. Whereas you, whenever we play Mario Kart and I'm inevitably winning, you..." His sentence trails off, he gets flustered just by the word.</p>
                <p>"Oh? What do I do~? Please, tell me Samikins, how do I cheat at Mario Kart~?"</p>
                <p>Sam blushes a little and looks down to hide it. "S-Shut up..."</p>
                <p>Jacob giggles softly, moving over to be closer to Sam, gently pulling at Sam's wing to get him to wrap it around him. Which, Sam obliges, wrapping a wing around Jacob and letting him cuddle. "I'm sorry, you just look so cute like that~"</p>
                <p>"I am not cute!"</p>
                <p>Jacob rolls his eyes. "Yes you are~" He looks down at the coffee table to see how Sam actually had his battleships board set up. There wasn't even only one instance of boats being less than a block away from each other, there were multiple. Jacob never stood a chance. At least not in the game. "... You are an asshole-"</p>
                <p>This time, Sam doesn't tell Jacob off for swearing. Mainly due to Jacob's tone of bewilderment and slight admiration. That smug grin tugs at Sam's lips again. "I know~"</p>

                <p>It's been one year since Jacob has gotten Jay to speak his first words towards him. That's great and all, it took him three years to be able to do it, but that's still pretty sad... Only talking... His tone is mostly monotone as well. He might as well be a robot.</p>

                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>----</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob wakes up to a pebble bouncing off his head, groaning softly and rolling over. "It's still dark outside..." He whines, covering his head with his arms to block out the morning rays of sunlight.</p>
                <p>"We have to keep going, they're closing in on us-" Jays deep but quiet voice penetrates through the silence of the forest. Well, almost silence. Birds and small animals can still be heard.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>They had just escaped from the lab. That's why Jay says they should keep moving, because he know that Jacob won't be able to survive much longer in that dang cell.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"I don't want t- Alright, alright, I'm going!" Jacob cuts himself off halfway as Jay started trying to drag him up to his feet. He looks up at the taller male tiredly, letting out a sigh. "Did you get any sleep? You really don't look good..."</p>
                <p>Jay dismissively waves Jacobs concerns off, pulling him to get him to start walking. "I'm fine, we need to get moving!" His expression and his voice both are void of any feelings, but his eyes... His electric blue eyes are filled with fear and paranoia as he tries to hurry Jacob along, staying alert to any disturbances around them.</p>
                <p>This makes Jacob's heart sink. This innocent boy is constantly tormented by his past, and there's not much the brunet can do about it. "Jay... When's the last time you were happy?" That stops the curly haired blonde in his tracks. "I just... You're always so stressed out and stuff. I mean, these circumstances aren't the best, we could die at any minute, but... You still deserve to be happy..."</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"...Happy? What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
                <p>Oh, his heart just plummeted down another foot-</p>
                <p>"You don't know what happiness is?"</p>
                <p>"..." The tall boy shakes his head. But then he focuses himself again. "It doesn't matter, we need to keep moving," he mutters as he grabs the midgets arm and pulls him through the trees and branches.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>Jacob shakes his head as well now, standing his ground and keeping Jay from continuing onward. "No, it does matter, Jay. It matters a lot." He walks up to Jay, softly wrapping his arms around his waist in a hug.</p>
                <p>Jay really wants to get out of this forest. He wants to get to safety. He doesn't have time for this. So, he puts his arms around Jacob and lifts him up bridal style, holding him close as he continues on walking like that.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>"Have you ever laughed? Smiled? Anything?" Jacob asks as he gives up and just curls up in Jay's arms, enjoying his warmth. But he does get an idea, softly slipping a hand under his shirt but making it seem like he was just trying to hug him more.</p>
                <p>The scared boy shrugs his shoulders. "Once. But then the scientists cut my finger off for it." He shivers a little at the feeling of Jacobs cold hand, but he loves any type of affection, so he doesn't mind.</p>
                <p>"But both of your hands have all fingers-" He starts to ever so lightly skitter his hand along Jay's bare side.</p>
                <p>"I was o-only five when it h-happened, it grew ba-ack... What a-are you doing?" Jay asks as he tries to keep walking, his breath catching in his throat a few times.</p>
                <p>A smirk rises to Jacob's lips as he goes a little harder, moving his hand up towards his ribs. "I'm trying to make you happy~"</p>
                <p>His lips twitch, but he fights to keep a straight face. "C-cut it o-out! We have to k-keep going. S-Stop horsing aro-ound!"</p>
                <p>Jacob adds his other hand in, reaching up and starting to scribble his fingers along his underarms. "Oh, come on~ We've been walking for days, you need a break~"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>A smile plays on Jays lip that he tries to fight back, but he can't help the giggles that start pouring out of him, his grip on Jacob starting to loosen a bit as he leans against a tree to support himself. His giggles have a weird sound to them. They sound like an anime schoolgirl giggle. "Stahap!"</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>This just encourages Jacob to keep going, speeding up a bit as well. "Aw, but that's such an adorable laugh~! And you need some laughter in your life~"</p>
                <p>Jay ends up falling to the ground, which makes it easier for Jacob to pin him down and start to really tickle him, which gets him squealing and laughing, kicking his legs a bit. "JaHaHACohOb!" His laughter is even higher pitched than his giggles. He kinda sounds like a dying dolphin-</p>
                <p>Jacob grins and keeps this up for a while, exploring all over to find sweet spots and make Jay laugh louder. It's... Freeing.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p><i>(This paragraph is from Jay's perspective, he sees life through metaphors-)</i></p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>All his life, it's been as if he were trapped in a dark room, blind, unable to know what was safe, but it's like... This bright light... This big ball of light in the sky has come pouring through the window, blocked only by the curtains. He's scared of the new change, so he keeps the curtains closed, blocking out the light as much as he can.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>But then once Jacob stops, Jay rolls over and pins the shorter boy down, attacking his ribs.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He opens the curtains. It's such a freeing feeling, like this weight has finally been lifted off of him, like he could fly if he wanted. Jacob has opened Jays eyes up to the true beauty of the world outside that window, the world he can finally see. Jacob is the sun and Jay is all the plants growing towards him, reaching for his light.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>He can finally see.</p>
                <p>He can finally be free.</p>
                <p>He can finally thrive and feel things he's never felt before.</p>
                <p>He can be happy.</p>
                <p>He knows what it means to be happy.</p>
                <p>It might seem like an exaggeration, but it's not. He's never felt so... So... So light. So free. So happy.</p>
                <div class='brLarge'></div>
                <p>It was the first time he's ever laughed. And Jay is sure Jacob won't let it be the last.</p>
