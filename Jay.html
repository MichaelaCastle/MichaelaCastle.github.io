                <p class="Tab0">There is no light</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Only darkness</p>
                <p class="Tab0">What is in ー the room ー is unknown</p>
                <p class="Tab0">All that is known</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Is that it's all I remember.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">This dark, dark room</p>
                <p class="Tab0">There is some shuffling about every once in a while ー</p>
                <p class="Tab1">From what, I do not know</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Some murmurs, some quarls</p>
                <p class="Tab0">A gust of wind chilling the foul air</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">A</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Sheet.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">No, that's not the word.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">A</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Curtain</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Set aglow, something shining behind it.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">A white curtain</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Seemingly glowing.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Quite peculiar.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">The light</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Faded behind the sheet of white</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Spills into the room</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Like water down a mountain.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Now it is clear</p>
                <p class="Tab1">This was never a room.</p>
                <p class="Tab1">This is a cage.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">The curtains ー they hang over steel bars</p>
                <p class="Tab1">A window</p>
                <p class="Tab2">With no pane, no protection</p>
                <p class="Tab3">To keep the cold winter air out.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The gray floor</p>
                <p class="Tab1">The gray walls</p>
                <p class="Tab2">The concrete box I'm in</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Is covered with blood</p>
                <p class="Tab1">The only splash of color</p>
                <p class="Tab2">In this little box of mine.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The door</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Much too thick than needed</p>
                <p class="Tab2">With a thousand locks to keep me in</p>
                <p class="Tab3">And no key in sight</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">The darkness was better than this</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It was better</p>
                <p class="Tab1">When I could not see to see</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It was better</p>
                <p class="Tab1">When there was no unbreakable door</p>
                <p class="Tab0">What is this light?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Why must it come to me?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Go bother someone else</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Go be a fairy somewhere else</p>
                <p class="Tab0">I like this little box of mine</p>
                <p class="Tab1">I don't want things to change.</p>
                <p class="Tab1">This box is all I've ever known</p>
                <p class="Tab2">I need more sheets</p>
                <p class="Tab3">To cover up that little light</p>
                <p class="Tab4">Tapping on my broken window.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">I spot a corner covered in red</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Calling out to me.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">If I can't keep my room the same</p>
                <p class="Tab0">This corner will have to do.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">This foul-smelling corner</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Will be the only thing</p>
                <p class="Tab2">I can call mine.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">I can not extinguish the light</p>
                <p class="Tab1">So I'll just have to block it out</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">But the light just gets brighter</p>
                <p class="Tab0">My heart beats faster</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Why won't it go away?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It's been so long</p>
                <p class="Tab1">I've been sitting here</p>
                <p class="Tab2">Alone</p>
                <p class="Tab1">For three long years</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Trying to block out the light</p>
                <p class="Tab0">What even is a year?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It's all just one big muddle of blackness.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">Maybe I should give that light a chance.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It has never done any harm</p>
                <p class="Tab1">It has never left me.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">…</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It has never left me</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Alone</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Maybe I could ask it</p>
                <p class="Tab0">“Hey</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Little light of mine</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Why are you still here?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Why</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Have you never left me</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Alone?”</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Maybe it knows</p>
                <p class="Tab1">How to break through those locks</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Sealing the door shut.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">So I gather my courage ー</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Push myself to my feet.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">With light tapping on the concrete floor</p>
                <p class="Tab0">I walk over to the curtains,</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Taking the sheets in my hands.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Soft, harmless sheets</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Blocking out the light.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">I fling them open,</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The ray of light rushing in</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Like an old friend</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Wrapping around me in a hug.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It's so blindingly bright</p>
                <p class="Tab1">So beautifully white and blue.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The light is behind the steel bar window,</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Flickering about with such energy.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">My heart yearns to join it ー</p>
                <p class="Tab1">That freely dancing sunshine</p>
                <p class="Tab0">But I am on the other side</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Peering out through cold</p>
                <p class="Tab2">Bloodstained bars.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">Once my eyes adjust</p>
                <p class="Tab1">The view behind the light</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Can finally be seen</p>
                <p class="Tab0">A grassy field with towering trees</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Flowers swaying in the wind.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It felt like winter inside my little box</p>
                <p class="Tab0">But out there it's summer</p>
                <p class="Tab1">When life flourishes</p>
                <p class="Tab2">When it thrives</p>
                <p class="Tab0">While I'm stuck in here</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Unable to spread my wings and fly</p>
                <p class="Tab0">What have I been doing all these years?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Why was I so scared?</p>
                <p class="Tab0">This light never threatened me</p>
                <p class="Tab1">It only wanted to lead</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Show me a better life</p>
                <p class="Tab2">So that I may flourish too.</p>
                <p class="Tab0"></p>
                <p class="Tab0">I cling onto the metal bars</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Tugging with all my might</p>
                <p class="Tab0">But no matter how hard I try</p>
                <p class="Tab1">The steel bars remain standing strong</p>
                <p class="Tab0">It's not until I realize the little light was not a light</p>
                <p class="Tab1">But something so much more</p>
                <p class="Tab0">That blinding brightness</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Can shine in me</p>
                <p class="Tab1">And shine</p>
                <p class="Tab1">I will try.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">This explosion of white light inside</p>
                <p class="Tab0">Puts a hand on my shoulder</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Offering me the strength</p>
                <p class="Tab2">The strength to break through my cage.</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The room around me crumbles</p>
                <p class="Tab1">Nothing more than specks of dust</p>
                <p class="Tab0">The warm summer air engulfs me</p>

        <div class="info" id="Personality">
            <p class='q'>Closest Stereotype</p>
            <p class='a'>Tsundere</p>
            <p class='q'>Overall Description</p>
            <p class='a'>Jay is very closed off and distant at first, but it's just because he's scared. He believes that if he let's people in, they will end up getting hurt because that's what happened to someone who used to be his boyfriend. He doesn't really understand social interactions nor can he read people at all, so he can only pick up on things like "hm, they seem sad" if it's obvious and in his face. Once he opens up to someone, he is like a giant teddy bear. He will protect them at all costs and all he'll want to do is cuddle with them. Even if they're just a friend. He doesn't see cuddles as a romantic thing.</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Likes</p>
            <p class='a'>Trees and nature. He lives in a tree. He loves being able to be in the freedom of the outdoors, where he can be sure that he will not be trapped because there will always be somewhere he can run.</p>
            <p class='a'>Physical affection of any kind. I often joke that he is hug-deprived because he is. Jacob showed him what physical affection was when he was about 14. He never knew what it was like before that. And ever since, he became very affectionate towards anyone close to him. It's how he demonstrates his appreciation. It's not a romantic thing (though it can be)</p>
            <p class='a'>Kittens. He just finds them really cute :3</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Dislikes</p>
            <p class='a'>Buildings without many windows and doors. This goes back to the outdoors thing, he doesn't like feeling trapped. If there aren't a lot of windows and doors, there aren't a lot of escape routes and he starts to feel trapped and helpless</p>
            <p class='a'>People who interrupt him. Sometimes it takes a little while for him to be able to respond, social interactions are hard for him. It's even harder when he's not given enough time to properly comprehend what was said and respond to the best of his abilities</p>
            <p class='a'>Anything related to magic and anything related to killing. Both of those remind him of the lab and make him paranoid or guilty. It's difficult for him to discuss it.</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Traits</p>
            <p class='a'>Affectionate and warm-hearted. He may not be able to use his words to explain himself very well, but he will always be able to use affection to demonstrate how much he cares about someone. And he will do anything to help that person be happy and content.</p>
            <p class='a'>Self-sacrificing. That is a positive thing, but he can be a bit too self-sacrifing to the point where it's self-destructive</p>
            <p class='a'>Strange. He is very strange. Sometimes he will speak in riddles. He doesn't seem to have human needs. He refuses to even touch a bed. The man is very strange and unusual.</p>
            <p class='a'>He is a man of extremes. He sees things as black and white. You're either good or bad, no in between. He either doesn't trust you at all, or trusts you with all his heart. His voice is super deep, his laugh is super high pitched. Everything about him is either 100% or 0%</p>
            <p class='a'>Naïve. He was locked up for three fourths of his life almost, he doesn't understand a lot of things, so a lot of things are new to him.</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Hobbies</p>
            <p class='a'>Drawing</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Greatest joy in life</p>
            <p class='a'>Cuddles. It always makes him happy</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Fears</p>
            <p class='a'>Letting someone in. He's terrified that if he let's someone get close to him again, they'll end up dying like his boyfriend. He doesn't know if he'd even be able to handle that</p>
            <p class='a'>Being happy. If he starts being happy again, it'll be harder to survive in the lab. If he doesn't feel anything, he has nothing to lose. But if he has happiness and hope, he has everything to lose.</p>
            <p class='a'>Losing control to the pendant. His necklace is always trying to force him to do what it wants, and sometimes it's even able to take full control over him for a short period of time. He's scared that one day it will have full control</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Love Language(s)</p>
            <p class='a'>Physical Touch: People who communicate their appreciation through this language, when they consent to it, feel appreciated when they are hugged, kissed, or cuddled. They value the feeling of warmth and comfort that comes with physical touch.</p>
            <p class='a'>Acts of Service: This love language is for people who believe that actions speak louder than words. Unlike those who prefer to hear how much they're cared for, people on this list like to be shown how they're appreciated. Doing the smaller and bigger chores to make their lives easier or more comfortable is highly cherished by these people.</p>
            <div class='br'></div>
            <p class='q'>Biggest Regret</p>

            <p class='a'>Jay is an rp-killer. He is so closed off and distant at the start that people often get stuck and can't make any progress with him. He acts like a brick wall sometimes, and it makes the rp hit a brick wall. If your character isn't persistent enough, gives up easily, or gets scared off easily, it's not going to work out with Jay. You will hit a brick wall. Jay is my hardest character to start an rp with.</p>
            <p class='a'>If you do manage to get past the beginning stages with him, the rp can be very interesting. Some of my best rps started with him.</p>

        <div class="sectionHeader" style="margin-top: 10px;" id="Pendant"><h1>What is the pendant?</h1></div>
        <h2>How was it created?</h2>
            <p>One day, Jay saw a blue tiger when he was only 3, and he decided to follow it into the woods. He was a toddler and didn't realize how dangerous that was. The tiger led him to a portal, and Jay tried to go through it. Nothing happened. So he tried again. And again, and again.</p>
            <p>Soon enough, it was too much and the portal suddenly flew up into the air, spinning rapidly. It exploded into a bunch of pieces, almost crushing Jay as the piece fell back to the ground but the tiger pushed him out of the way. Not wanting to lose it forever, the tiger pushed the pieces together and pulled off some magic that condensed all the broken pieces into a small crystal on a coppery chain. Then it gave the necklace to Jay for safe-keeping.</p>
        
        <h2>Why was it there?</h2>
            <p>That tiger from before came from another dimension, a dimension full of prophets and shapeshifters. She was only a kid, and she messed with the timeline. That was a huge crime, and the higher ups sentenced her to be banished to a different dimension. That's where the portal came from. But it was a one way portal, so she couldn't go back because she was banned. So going through it did nothing. She thought maybe another creature could go through and convince the higher ups to give her another chance, that's why she got Jay. She just wanted to go back home and see her family.</p>
        
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>Well, it gave Jay powers. He was able to use the magic that was held within the crystal and harness its energy.</p>
        
        <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
            <p>One day, the scientists went too far. In trying to find out how to make magic, they pushed Jay and the pendant too far. The pendant turned from it's red color to a golden-ish glow, which seeped into his heart, infecting it. The heart infected his blood, which then went throughout his entire body. Once it got to his brain, the pendant was able to talk to Jay. It gained a mind of its own. Because of the awful situation Jay was in, the pendant learned to be scared of everyone and to view everyone and everything as a threat. So, it always wants Jay to kill and eliminate all threats. It is still just a rock, it has no empathy or emotions.</p>
            <p>Jay however does not want to kill people, he doesn't like listening to the pendant. So the pendant has to use other methods to make him do what it tells him. It yells at him, burns him, makes him relive memories he wants to forget over and over until he gives in. It uses him like he's nothing but a vessel.</p>
        
        <h2>What do the colors mean?</h2>
            <p>Blue - It's in its normal state and isn't using magic.</p>
            <p>Red - It's overheated. Either it's using too much energy or it's mad at Jay and thus overheats, burning him.</p>
            <p>Gold - Jay has pushed it past the danger phase and it is now trying to take total control over him. Jay's eyes will turn red at this point too, but they go back to normal after he sleeps.</p>
        
        <h2>What powers can he use?</h2>
            <p>All.</p>
        
        <h2>Isn't that OP?</h2>
            <p>No, because he can only use magic for a very short amount of time, and the harder the magic, the more it takes out of him. The pendant overheats very fast, so he doesn't like using magic. It also gives the pendant more control over him.</p>
        
        <h2>How does the particle affect him?</h2>
            <p>It doesn't. The pendant is able to maintain his heath and sanity. It doesn't let the particle enter his body because that threatens to take away some of the power it holds over him.</p>
        
        <h2>How much of Jay's health does it regulate? And why?</h2>
            <p>If Jay dies, it dies, so it will not let Jay die. He doesn't need to eat, he doesn't need to sleep, he can be stabbed, he can be shot, he can jump off a building, he will not die. The pendant heals him just enough to stay alive. Though, it will not let any wound heal, it keeps those from getting better. Then when it needs them, it can open up all those wounds to hurt Jay and make him listen. It has all the power over Jay. If he didn't have the pendant, he would be dead.</p>
